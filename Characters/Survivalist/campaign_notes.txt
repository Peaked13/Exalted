3/27/21:
	-We recieved a note from someone claiming to be the last, Eclipse-caste member of our ancient
	 circle, reincarnated at last.
		-See Lesley's intro in Roll20.
	-We sought the rooms spoken of in the note and, in The Valley of Death, we spotted a wagon with
	 our old foes', The Eyes in the Hills, outside an old tomb.
		-It was full of corpses, that soon started to move!
		-Battle was joined!
		-Short work was made of them.
	-As we stepped into The Tomb of Five Corners, we were overwhelmed by memories of a past life.
		-In shining golden robes, we once walked in this place, a crossroads somehow linking realms
		 we once ruled.
		-Noises, though, echoed from the inside. Noises in the present, calling us back to it.
		-Sneaking in, Naria saw 12 men in two groups.
			-In a chamber with five exits, each matching a Solar caste mark.
			-They wore the markings of The Eyes in the Hills.
		-In a surprise attack, many of them fell, and soon they were broken.
			-Despite Naria and myself attempting to talk him out of it, Golden Blade cut down all
			 of those that surrendered, naming them slavers.
	-Strange mists and light had begun to emerge from the doors surrounding the chamber.
		-Naria seemed to recall something about medallions, used with the dias.
	-We entered the one with the Night Caste symbol, following, strangely, the smell of the sea.
		-We found ourselves through a portal, standing on a pillar above the sea.
		-More pillars stood in the sea around us, as well as a large disk with a sarcophagus on it.
		-Naria seemed to be repeatedly overcome by visions of a past life. This place was familiar
		 to her. . .
		-She was able to leap from column to column, reaching the great disk and it's sarcophagus.
		-She retrieved from it a shining golden bow, and a medallion.
	-Flipping a coin, I was up next.
		-Can't say I was too eager to face this.
		-At the door, we were met by a cold wind.
		-On the other side, we stood betweened the severed feet of some long gone statue, all of
		 Eastern Creation spread out beneath us.
			-We could only be far up the slope of The Imperial Mountain, at the center of creation.
			-Surrounding us was a ruined city, perhaps the very seat of the ancient Solar
			 Deliberative.
			-The statue, now broken on the ground miles below, was made of many colors of jade, and
			 was of The Unconquered Sun.
			-I named the ground sacred and so it was. I could feel essence imbued in everything
			 around us.
		-I descended the steps between the feet, toward a gate set in the ground.
			-As I did so, I found myself mumbling a prayer in a language I did not know, but which
			 my tongue seemed to know well.
			-As I spoke the prayer, golden lines began to glow in the statue's jade, and words on
			 the steps, that I somehow recognized as the script of The Old Realm.
			-At the bottom of the steps, there was a white table on which rested ash filled white
			 robes and a golden spear, divided into three pieces, with an image of The Unconquered
			 Sun.
				-The other end of the spear had a second, needle-like head, made of strange metal.
				-I somehow recalled that, in _my_ hands, the spear would reassemble itself, but
				 could be wielded by no other.
				-Beneath the robe, too, I felt another medallion.
			-I took up my spear once more and retrieved the medallion, then slowly turned and left.
				-Base Damage Str+8 Lethal, but has a minimum damage of 12 ("Onslaught Damage of 12")
				-The rest of the stats, for this "Dire Lance"
	-Next was Golden Blade.
		-His door dumped us straight into an intensely hot desert.
		-Active volcanoes on the horizons completed the picture of what must be the very deep South.
		-Though smoke blackened the sky and dust blew, I was able to spot a door in a hill nearby.
			-No, not a hill but a temple, half buried in the sands.
			-The open doorway led to a large, cool chamber, with stairs leading up.
			-There, in a dark, pillar filled room, Golden Blade illuminated his caste mark,
			 revealing corpses.
				-Blade immediately began to stab at one of them. Some enemy of his past self?
			-One of the corpses, though, walked forward, carrying an enormous golden sword and
			 bedecked in white and gold armor.
			-As it approached, it dropped into a fighting stance. . .
				-The air seemed to thicken, slowing Naria and myself. This fight seemed to be for
				 Golden Blade.
				-It was hard fought, but Golden Blade once again wields his namesake, and a
				 medallion.
		-I burned the corpses as we left, to ensure no more of them rise.
