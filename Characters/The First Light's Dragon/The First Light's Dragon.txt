	 you.
		-Worded it as "The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon is the only family you have (left)
		 and must be protected from the outside world."
	-We also get a free one, to one of the two individuals everyone in the circle is loyal to.

	-TODON'T: Drop Specialties and Cult for Hidden Manse Merit (Scroll of Heroes pg. 57)?
		-Seems like it might be required for the way you've characterized your Manse.
		-Considered ditching Artifact, but sounds like the Hearthstone needs to be in an artifact
		 for you to get it's intrinsic effect too.
		-Oh! It says it's for use if you _don't_ have Oadenol's with that having some more detailed
		 system.
			-Yeah, using that system, you can probably hide it to the extent necessary with nothing
			 extra.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Character art: https://i.imgur.com/fN7gX22.jpg
	-You are the reincarnation of The _Last_ Light's Dragon, the former owner of your manse, prophecied
	 to be reborn amongst the monks of your ancient order that dwell within it.
		-More title than name, _you'll_ eventually be "The Last", after you die. . .
	-Your manse stands in a hidden vale, known only to the monks of your (now _your_) order, few of
	 whom ever leave.
		-They're known as The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon.
			-They're martial artists and thaumaturges, with a specialty in Astrology.
				-The few who leave the monastary, to trade for what they're not self sufficient in
				 and to keep an eye on the surrounding lands, survive as traveling astrologers.
		-The manse's hidden vale is somewhere a bit NE of The Range Towns of Maruken.
	-You grew up in it's ornate halls, yet another foundling taken in and raised to become one of
	 the monks.
		-When your Exaltation came as a teenager, you went from expectations of humbleness to the
		 venerated center of attention, heir to the manse, it's treasures, and the service of the
		 order of monks.
			-Good opportunity for roleplay. When stressed, you can fall back into old patterns.
				-Maybe how you refer to yourself? Normally "I", but sometimes falling back into
				 "This one"?
		-After that, your education continued to focus on martial arts and occult secrets, but the
		 specifics changed dramatically. Ancient tomes, painstakingly copied again and again over
		 the centuries, were brought forth and you learned the techniques of the Solar Exalted.
		-Your teachers, once harsh authority figures, were now obsequious but no less infuriating,
		 as you underwent a sorcerous initiation prescribed many centuries ago by your predecessor.
	-Your sorcerous initiation:
		-Sacrifice? Some link to your past, before being adopted into the order?
			-Your memories of whatever past he had before child-monk adoption. (Jeeze.)
				-"I gave up _my mother's face!_"
	-Eventually, your long education reached it's conclusion, and your life was, for the very first
	 time, your own.
		-You're also in possession a powerful manse, it's centuries-dwindled treasures, and a small
		 order of monks trained in martial arts and thaumaturgy, ready now to once again participate
		 in the world at large, with their master's return.
			-The reopening of the manse, according to instructions laid down more than a millennium
			 ago, was a sight to behold. You had _thought_ the manse ornate, as compared to the rude
			 out-buildings constructed around it over the centuries, and so it was, compared to what
			 you've now seen of the world away from it. The monks pulled down it's fine wood
			 paneling, though, to reveal great murals alongside carved and gilded stone work, all
			 depicting The Unconquered Sun and his Solar Exalts.
			-Weirdly, as soon as you came into your inheritance in full, some of the monks requested
			 your permission to marry one another. Apparently the order had not been intended to be
			 celebate, but rather forbade sex outside of marriages sanctioned by The Dragon.
				-You kind of get the impression that your predecessor didn't intend to be gone this
				 long. . .
		-Or, perhaps not _all_ of it's treasures. You reached the end of your prescribed education
		 period, but there are a few areas of the manse that no one goes, forbidden to the order,
		 and you as well.
			-Carved warnings stand at the entrances, speaking of grave danger to all who enter, but
			 also of signs and portents that will indicate that The First Light's Dragon should now
			 venture within. The monks claim that all who have ever violated the warning and entered
			 were never seen again. . .

Equipment:
	-Fine Buff Jacket
		-Soak of 4L/5B as a result of Fine.
	-A hooded cloak
		-It is usually wise to hide the sorcerous transformation of your body.
	-Leather and cloth wrappings, concealing the bracer's you wear and are very seldom without.
	-A wrought iron ring.
	-A hooded lantern and some fuel.

Manse Design (see Oadenol's pg. 66):
	-Creation points:
		-8 for rank 4 manse.
		-6 for downsides.
	-Downsides:
		Fragility 2
		Maintenance 4
			-Performed by the monks.
			-Perhaps also tied to their archive copying duties, creating and burning copies of some
			 ritual document.
	-Powers:
		-Greater Veil of Shadows (4):
			-Even beyond the manse's remote location, it is hidden from prying eyes through clever
			 geomantic means. The eye simply refuses to notice it's valley until one is within it,
			 at which point the manse's traps take care of the rest (Oadenol's pg. 76).
		-Provider (3):
			-The manse automatically provides air, water, and food enough to sustain a group with
			 Magnitude equal to it's level + 1.
		-Ultra-Deadly Traps (3):
			-To approach your manse, or to leave it, is to pass through a harrowing gauntlet of
			 incredibly dangerous traps. Only a few of the monks, and now you, know the paths,
			 passwords, and mechanisms that allow for safe passage. It has kept the manse safe from
			 any who have pierced it's Veil, whether intentionally or not, for centuries (Oadenol's
			 pg. 76).
		-Archive (2):
			-The library in the manse contains many scrolls and loosely bound books. The vast
			 majority of them date from The First Age, and have been painstakingly copied over the
			 centuries by the monks of The Order (though the manse's magical conveniences aid in
			 that somewhat). The small number of later additions contain recent (or at least _more_
			 recent) observations about the manse's surroundings, the local developments and
			 hazards, by the monks themselves.
			-Topics selected:
				-First Age Lore (Lore Specialty)
				-Thaumaturgy (Occult Specialty)
				-Five Terrestrial Circle Spells:
					Emerald Countermagic
					Invulnerable Skin of Bronze
					Stormwind Rider
					Wood Dragon's Claw
					Burning Eyes of the Offender (White Treatise pg. 39)
				-Five more Terrestrial Circle Spells:
					Incantation of Effective Restoration (White Treatise pg. 49)
					Personal Tempest (White Treatise pg. 55)?
					Ritual of Elemental Empowerment (White Treatise pg. 57)
					Spoke the Wooden Face (White Treatise pg. 61)?
					The Spy Who Walks in Darkness (White Treatise pg. 62)
		-Comfort Zone (1):
			-The environment within the area of the manse is always comfortable, despite the high
			 mountain valley in which it's situated, which should by all rights be cold with thin
			 air (Oadenol's pg. 66).
		-Magical Conveniences (1):
			-Your manse features various magical conveniences (Oadenol's pg. 67).
			-Conveniences selected:
				-Advanced training room
				-Azure canvases of dictation
				-Moonsilver plaque providing self-updating library catalog.
				-Everyone who sleeps in the manse is awakened just before dawn by a chime audible to
				 only them, and they hear a similar chime every hour until dusk while they remain
				 within the grounds of the manse.

Advancement:
	-Specialties look like a good deal at 3 XP each.
		-The XP chart claims you can "purchase the same specialty multiple times", which indicates
		 you can get +3 dice to Martial Arts unarmed.
			-More of your Dodge specialty is way cheaper than just advancing it (but training time!).
		-First Age Lore would be a very flavorful _and_ useful one for you.
	-More Snake Style!
		-Starting the other branch, beginning with Snake Strikes the Heel, looks more attractive
		 than Armor-Pentrating Fang Strike, since latter is expensive, because the cheaper Essence
		 Fangs and Scales you already have does half of it already, and because it's a dead end
		 until you complete the other branch anyways.
		-The extra action charm, of that other branch, is amazing.
	-More spells, starting with the stuff in your archive.
		-The Spy is amazing!
		-(DONE!) Spoke the Wooden Face might give you easy access to all the rest.
			-"Hold the book up to the tree!"
		-Ritual of Elemental Empowerment will make you friends.
		-Burning Eyes of the Offender is another substantial bump to your defenses.
		-Mists of Eventide puts people to sleep, an interesting attack.
		-Peacock Shadow Eyes. Mind control. Dark, but useful.
	-Dodge Charms, especially Reflex Sidestep Technique are fairly attractive.
	-More Ox-Body is the only Resistance one that looks especially useful to you.
		-Too much duplication of your spells.
		-More Ox-Body _is_ straight great, though!
	-(DONE!) Investigation 2 would only cost you one XP.
	-Medicine?
		-No one else is good at it, and, as in character reasons, you both saw it's need at The
		 Invisible Manse, when your allies were injured, and saw Larquen had thought it worth his
		 time (though, gods, the terrible ends he put that knowledge too. . .).
		-The Charms are pretty solid too, though truely amazing stuff requires tax-y charms, multiple
		 one in a combo, etc.
			-Instant healing never quite happens, though.
			-Temp health level for 10m committed per, for you or others, _does_ happen, though.
	-Lore Charms?
		-Essence-Lending Method is a strong argument for the circle giving you every hearthstone we
		 find, would then be genuinely good, and is available to you now.
		-Lore 5 plus an excellency or two allows genuinely ridiculous stuff, like leadership-essence-pool
		 and the (XP-less?) you-and-group training ones.
			-Ah, PCs pay XP, but XP isn't tracked for NPCs. . .
			-Still tends to lead to _faster_ training times for PCs too.
		-The Wyld stuff is pretty cool too.
			-Forge a demesne in Nexus?!?
			-Or make crazy mutants? Applying Wyld Mutations seems amazing.
				-See Craft(Genesis) below for where these are found.
				-Compass - The Wyld pg. 150 details the limits of what can be applied and still
				 survive in Creation.
			-Usefulness will depend on what kind of Wyld the zone in Nexus counts as, and on your
			 ability to add Int+Lore successes to the very difficult Charm roll.
	-With Essence 4, Martial Arts Essence Flow becomes possible, perhaps making getting that and
	 another Martial Arts Excellency tempting.
		-It makes the other Excellency innate, allowing you to use it with other charms without
		 combos.
		-As other Abilities reach 5, similar pairs for those abilities may be attractive.
			-Dodge, in particular.
		-Hmm. . . those excellencies are pretty good on their own, and with the Infinite one too.
	-Celestial Sorcery is now possible, but a whole narrative thing you'll need to
	 work on with Lesley.
		-Second Circle Demons are awesome.
		-Imbue Amalgam is a route to similar stuff to as Wyld shaping. Cheaper to access, but a
		 more than a bit slave-y.
		-Threefold Binding of the Heart is even more powerful mind control.
	-Necromancy may also be an appealing direction, as the Neverborn's minions are proving a problem
	 for us. Larquen's spell manual has great stuff for fighting ghosts.
	-All the cool Occult charms are now available, with Occult 5 and Essence 4.
	-First Age Crafts (BoS I pg. 8)?
		-Craft(Magitech) is a ways off, because you need Crafts Fire and Air at 2, and another at 1.
			-Does cool stuff, though, and could help you make a Factory-Cathedral.
		-Craft(Genesis) _is_ easily accessed, now just needing Medicine up to whatever rank you want
		 it at.
			-Thematic, and very Larquen. It even seems like he left you some amount of laboratory
			 beneath the manse, and some details about these "chao-morphic symbiotes".
			-Where I find info on Wyld mutations, something the symbiotes and this in general can
			 duplicate?
				-Ah, a different book contained a summary, for a charm:
					Core pg. 288 
					Manual of Exalted Power - Lunars pg. 206
					Compass, Vol. II - The Wyld pg. 144
				-Yeah, these are great. A good argument for both this skill (and thus symbiotes)
				 and for Wyld Cauldron Technique.
					-Amazing stuff:
						4	Enlightened Essence (Compass pg. 148)
						4	Lidless Demon Eye (knock off Sorcerer Sight) (Lunars pg. 208)
						6	Wings (Core pg. 290)
						1	Large (and progressively bigger in later for 2, 4, etc.) (Compass pg. 144)
						1	Longevity (Compass pg. 144)
				-Pg. 144 of Compass - The Wyld assigns the point values for the different classes of
				 mutation, while pg. 150 discusses the details of what happens when that sum starts
				 to exceed the Willpower of those so inflicted.
	-Tentative schedule:
