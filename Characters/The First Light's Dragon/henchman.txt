		-He's a Cult of the Illuminated priest, since not long after his conversion, having shown
		 obvious potential, and useful prior training.
	Influence: 1
		-Within The Cult of the Illuminated around Nexus Yflea is recognized for his devotion and
		 wisdom, and many mortal cultists look to him for guidance in interpreting their visions
		 and in serving The Shining Ones.
		-Some of the general populace, particularly among the low, recognize him for his charitable
		 works, healing the sick and injured.
		-Yflea is also known among the thaumaturgical colleges of Nexus, as a skilled thaumaturge
		 and learned sage.
	"Inheritance": 2
		-12 extra bonus points.
		-Lesley suggested something neither of us can quite find: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/922561734605160518
			-He suggested the Inheritance background is similar, in SoH pg. 127
			-Yeah, we'll just use that as a guideline unless we can find the other.
				-Probably limit yourself to the one or two dots Lesley suggested.
	Resources: 1
		-The Cult helped him get set up in Nexus, supporting himself by providing thaumaturgical
		 services to the general public. Most of his time is spent on Cult projects, though,
		 limiting his personal wealth and meaning he needs other resources (usually from the Cult)
		 to engage in his most complicated rituals.
		-Lesley suggested having him work at one the thaumaturgical schools in Nexus, which also helps
		 his workings, providing lab access, and an agent of The Cult in a useful place.
	

Thaumaturgical Rituals:
	Alchemy (3rd Degree):
		Alchemical Touchstone (0, Perception, 1, one action) (Oadenol's pg. 130):
			-Each touchstone identifies one material it's rubbed against. May require advanced prep,
			 but is then quick to use for the season it lasts.
		Blood-Staunching Compress (1, Intelligence, 3, one hour) (Oadenol's pg. 130):
			-Treated bandages automatically stop bleeding, and wound does not reopen with out combat
			 or Athletics botch. Retain potency for a year.

			-Thrown weapon that inflicts -4 wound penalty on hit target until scrubbed from skin
			 (see Wonders of the Lost Age pg. 74).
		Final Vengeance (2, Wits, 3, one hour) (Oadenol's pg. 131):
			-For one scene, imbiber ignores wound penalties and auto-succeeds Valor checks. After
			 effects end, Stamina becomes 1, recovering 1 per day of rest, halving healing until
			 Stamina recovers.
		Hero's Recovery (1, Intelligence, 3, one hour) (Oadenol's pg. 130):
			-Imbiber heals as an Exalt does for 1/2 day per Stamina. Stamina doses in a row double
			 healing time instead.
		Philtre of Desire (2, Intelligence, 2, one hour) (Oadenol's pg. 131):
			-Version 1: Imbiber gets +2 dice to Performance, Presence, and Socialize against target
			chosen when made, requiring an arcane link.
			-Version 2: Reduces imbiber's MDV by 2. Victim chosen when made, requiring an arcane link.
			-For +1 difficulty, can ignore above arcane link requirements.

			-Stamina + Resistance, difficulty 1, for imbiber to heal any disease but leprosy or
			 The Great Contagion.
		Wind-Fire Potion (3, Wits, 4, one hour) (Oadenol's pg. 132):
			-+1 die to Physical Attributes, Wits, and Valor, but -1 to Compassion, Temperance,
			 and Intelligence. No longer count as an extra (Heroic Mortals get two -4 HLs). Lasts
			 one scene, and addictive if used > 1/month (difficulty doses during month + 2).
	Astrology (1st Degree):

			-Using a star chart (Resources 2) and the target's astrological profile, make a

Flavor stuff:
	-Yflea in Garn's cult, having been all to familiar with the young man's flaws.
		-Garn was a poor student, especially after his Exaltation, more focused on martial arts
		 than the thaumaturgy Yflea prided himself in.
	-He was an enthusiastic convert of The Cult of the Illuminated, though.
		-It provided major confirmation of some of the same concepts Garn's monks had held true,
		 and broader target of worship than his flawed pupil.
		-Seeing a bit of the training camp, and of a changed Garn, Yflea ultimately found that Garn
		 _did_ stand out from even the Shining pack, and found himself again swearing himself to
		 Garn personally.
			-There may have been some Inner Circle/Sidereal influence setting this up, as a lesson
			 showing Garn that The Cult can convert even his old, scornful teacher to outright
			 worship. If so, it's a dangerous gambit that could easily backfire.
	

Planning:
	-Eventual amalgamation:
		-Sorcery?
			-Demon Summoning? Compare the dice pools.
		-Training charms?
		-Occult Excellency, to help the Thaumaturgy?
		-Get Garn Immanent Solar Glory before doing this? More motes to spend on the casting, and
		 can even give this to Yflea.
		-Will need to be able to move covertly, given new appearance.
			-Second Larceny Excellency and Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise? You have both, but will
			 they suffice to hide amalgam-y-ness?
			-Dots in Stealth plus a decent Dexterity?
		-Maybe a shifting, liquid-y and color changing metalic form? Would fit the alchemy, high Dex,
		 and disguise/stealth stuff. Would also look impressive 
	-Attractive professions:
		-Monk, of course.
		-Scholar or Thaumaturge?
			-More likely the latter. Read up on Thaumaturgy again.
	-Potential Merits and Flaws:
		-Eidetic Memory (3 pt. Merit, Scroll of Heroes pg. 52)
		-Experienced (1-3 pt. Merit, Scroll of Heroes pg. 53)
			-Trades one bonus point and one attribute point for five ability dots.
			-Attribute dots are 4 bonus points, and Abilities 1 or 2 each, depending on Favored.
			-With Amalgam, Attributes are 2 motes and Abilities 1.
		-Diminished Attributes (3 pt. per attribute Flaw, Scroll of Heroes pg. 66)
		-Oathbound (variable Flaw, Scroll of Heroes pg. 72)
			-Super appropriate, but maybe cheat-y.
	-Thaumaturgy? See pg. 138 of Core for rules.
		-Each degree is 10 XP or 5 bonus points, or 8 XP and 4 bonus if Occult is Favored.
		-Consumed Resource cost of rituals is 0 for 0, 0-1 for 1st degree, 2-3 for 2nd, and 4 to 5 for Master.
			-Also needs laboratory of cost Resources 1 for 0, 2 for 1st degree, 3 for 2nd, and 4 for Master.
		-Alchemy, Geomancy, Enchantment, and Warding all bear promise. Alchemy and Warding are 
		 probably the top candidates, for the wide array of useful stuff they provide.
		-Talked to Lesley:
			-Occult in free rituals per Art when you purchase Degrees at character.
				-Ward Against (Creature) is one ritual, while the *sights are seperate ones. Basically,
				 how the book prints it.
				-What about 0-level rituals in other Arts? _Another_ 5 of those, similar to what Garn did?
					-Oh! If you still get rituals per Occult dot _on top_ of what any degrees in an Art
					 provide, can that be applied to the Arts you do have degrees in? There were a
					 couple of other interesting-but-minor Alchemy rituals, and good Warding stuff too.
					-Yep, you get them: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/925523406634483723
			-1 Bonus per recipe beyond
	-I wrote up a lot about the general concept for Lesley here: 
		I threw together a possible henchman: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/922266724760420402
		https://github.com/Peaked13/Exalted/blob/main/Characters/The%20First%20Light's%20Dragon/henchman.txt
		Take a look when you've got a chance, and then I've also got some questions about what you'd recommend for backgrounds and how you want to do Thaumaturgy rituals for someone with degrees.

		The general concept I was going for was one of Garn's monks, but one who was _not_ a member of Garn's cult (my Followers and Cult backgrounds suggested more followers than I had worshipers). I'm picturing a former teacher who was all too acquainted with Garn's faults, and who thus had a fair bit of trouble accepting him as the messiah they'd been waiting for. On the other hand, I'm imagining the henchman _did_ really take to The Cult of the Illuminated, since it was more or less compatible with the beliefs of the monks _without_ requiring that he believe the little shit who wouldn't pay attention in Thaumaturgy class (or Potions class, lol; viewing this as an extended Harry Potter allusion is only occurring to me now) is the _sole_ messiah, at least. It also look a little less self-serving than what Garn's past incarnation set up.

		By the time  he's _again_ pledging himself to Garn, though, he's much more the true believer, The Cult having sold him, and Garn's different too: he's a first rate Occultist, a bit less intemperate, and someone who really _does_ stand out from the other (NPC) Solars of The Cult. He's now a lot more dedicated to Garn then he ever was before. I also wouldn't be surprised if his conversion may have had something to do with the mind-control-y charms that the Inner Circle of The Cult seems to use liberally, or if that conversion is something of a message to Garn: "Look, through us, even the teacher that hated you is now bowing at your feet."

		I'm looking to use the henchman to both play around with Thaumaturgy (which I could never quite justify using Garn's XP on) and to play with Garn's relationship with The Cult. I gave the henchman some social skills, but I'm looking for some backgrounds that would be a good fit for and up-and-coming priest in The Cult, with some influence over the other mortals. Someone who would be good for creating some tension between whether The Cult is proving the value of Garn aligning with it or whether Garn is building a personal powerbase within The Cult. I also have an eye towards eventual amalgamation. Between his age/infirmity and the impact of awakened Essence on his art of Thaumaturgy, I can imagine this guy being ecstatic about that "blessing", and thrilled to preach that he's a living example of how The Shining Ones will lift up their faithful servants.
	-Oh! Ask about character sheet in Roll20 for this guy.
