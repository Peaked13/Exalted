Demons Active:
	-Agatae, The Beauteous Wasps (Books of Sorcery V pg. 69)
		-Summoned: 12th day of Ascending Wood(Spring Time)
		-Abscissic Binding: The Ecstatic (Compassion)
		-Was summoned at your monastery, so Hurry Home (5m, BoS IV pg. 142) allows it, and even a
		 Magnitude 1 group, to return there.
		-Was instructed to wait at the monastery for word from you via the tree, and to obey the
		 instructions of a list of trusted senior monks.
			-The monks, meanwhile, were all instructed that they may converse with the beautiful
			 philosopher-steed, and that trusted list was told they may make cautious use of the
			 creature in emergencies, like speedily reaching me in Nexus.
	-Luminata, the Deer That Hunt Men (Books of Sorcery V pg. 80)
		-Summoned: 11th day of Ascending Wood(Spring Time)
		-Abscissic Binding: The Hunter (Conviction) (Books of Sorcery V pg. 35)
		-The Luminata has been instructed to guard the approaches to the monastery, and to check in
		 with the monks whenever intruders are sighted, with them having say over who it hunts.
			-In particular, it was warned about two very dangerous quarries, the Larquen clones,
			 that I'm also very interested in. It was given samples of Larquen clone flesh, and
			 warned to face them only with the full force of monks too, as they're perfectly
			 capable of banishing it from Creation and ending it's hunt (it's motivation).
	-Sesseljae, The Stomach Bottle Bugs (Books of Sorcery V pg. 86)
		-Summoned: 10th day of Ascending Wood(Spring Time)
		-Abscissic Binding: The Ecstatic (Compassion) (Books of Sorcery V pg. 33)
		-Kept in your stomach until needed, with instructions to stay there.
		-Periodically rewarded with booze. Also forms a sort of Ulysses Pact, limiting Garn's
		 drinking (a function of his low Temperance), which he has to admit slowed his return to
		 the monastery when the Larquen clones there first awoke.
