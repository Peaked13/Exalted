4/12/21:
	-Exalted for roughly a month now, we're based out of Nexus.
		-Nexus is the 2nd largest city in the world, with 2/3rds of a million residents.
			-It's a strange city.
			-It's most serious laws are enforced by the Emissary, a creature that has served The
			 Council of Nexus since the founding of the city. The penalty is always an inventively
			 gruesome death.
				-That "dogma" says (eh, see pg. 63 of Core rules for exact text):
					No taxes shall be raised except by the council.
					No one shall interfere with trade.
					No one will bring an army into Nexus.
						-Mercenary companies carefully circumvent this, only going about in small groups.
					None shall commit wanton violence.
						-Obstruction of trade is a heavy component of what makes it "wanton".
						-Boxing and serial killers have both managed to evade that qualifier.
					None shall falsely claim the the council's name or sanction.
					None shall harbor a a fugitive from the council.
			-There are also the far more minor "civilities". They can and do change.
				-Longstanding ones include:
					You can't drink alone after nightfall.
					The solar known as Harmonious Jade is not allowed within the walls of Nexus.
	-We're each either in the service of Silver-Tongued Rishi or the mercenary captain Hawk who
	 is under contract to Rishi.
		-Silver-Tongued Rishi is a Scavenger Lord, one who seeks out wonders from The First Age.
			-He makes his home near the Wyld Zone of the Firewander district.
		-Hawk is well-famed and thought to be blessed by the gods, having never lost a battle.
			-He leads Hawk's Chargers, who are based out of a compound in the NW of the Cinnabar
			 district.
		-I sought out Silver-Tongued Rishi for his knowledge of The First Age and it's works, with
		 designs on learning the trade and taking it up myself.
			-I've kept the fact that I'm a Solar Exalted from him thus far (I think).
	-We remember that we were a circle in our past lives, and can feel that the others are somehow
	 special when in their presence.

	Questions for @everyone to consider;

	How did you exalt?
	------------------
		(I'd originally had in mind having Exalted quite a bit longer than a month ago, in part owing to the training time involved in sorcery, but having spent all of that time cloistered and studying until, yeah, roughly a month ago I left the monastery for the first time since childhood. What I've written below reflects that, but we can certainly adjust it if need be.)
		.   Your Exaltation came when you were 15, amidst a very particular sparring match. As a rite of passage, you were to face one of the full monks of the order, and to defeat your opponent (on the first attempt or the 17th) was required to earn your place among them. To your dismay, when the day came, you found yourself facing Brother Jin, well known for his martial prowess, who you were to face again and again until you defeated him, a seemingly impossible task.
		.   Your fears were realized as, from the moment the match started, Brother Jin began delivering a savage beating. It wasn't right! How could you be expected to defeat a seasoned warrior who still stood nearly a foot taller than you? You weren't sure you could be expected _to walk away from this_.
		.   You know now that you weren't expected to ever win. Your skill in martial arts was your pride, but this was as much a lesson in humility as a test of your abilities, and you were overmatched. Had your greatest talents lain in some other direction, perhaps something more scholarly, the trial would have been different, but you would still have been setup to fail at something at which you excelled. Full admission to the order was to come with the admission of defeat, and the martial version of the trial was thought to be an especially effective and. . . visceral version of the lesson.
		.   Instead of learning your lesson, something altogether more dramatic occurred. You managed to keep your feet, if not your ground, for a few moments into the match, though you were hurting badly and not likely to last much longer. Brother Jin threw a punch meant to end the fight, but, though it struck your face, your flesh was as unyielding stone, and your anima flared for the first time. Quick as lightening, before those watching the bout had fallen to their knees, you were on Brother Jin, stiking him again and again. It took you a moment to realize Jin was no longer resisting, and a longer one to grasp what had happened just happened and why everyone in the room lay prostrate on the floor. Brother Jin walked away with serious injuries, and as one of your most fervent followers.

	What brought you to nexus?
	--------------------------
		.   You were charged by your past incarnations with restoring yourself and the world around you to glory beneath The Unconquered Sun, and raised from a young age to believe in that mission. When you left the monastery, you did so in search of the lore and other remnants of The First Age that could enable you to actually accomplish so immense a goal.
		.   Seeing the outside world for the first time since early childhood, your conviction in your mission was redoubled. You had thought your upbringing and training in the monastery harsh, even brutal, and all for (originally) the station of a humble servant, but you had never experienced real _deprivation_, the needs of the monks being tended to by the manse itself. Outside your hidden valley, you first witnessed lives far worse than that of a well fed servant. The world had fallen far, and something had to be done.
		.   Your monastery being in the mountains of the Marukan Alliance, and Lookshy being a dangerous place for your kind, you headed straight to the nearby city of Nexus. Marked on the maps in your library as the old city of Hollow, those few members of your order who traveled (peddling charms for absent necessities and keeping an eye on the surrounding countryside) warned you it was a far different place today, but also confirmed that you might be able to find First Age artifacts or lore sold there.

	How/why did you meet rishi/hawk?
	--------------------------------
		.   Once in Nexus, you sought out places where First Age remnants were bought and sold. Naive where the outside world is concerned, you encountered many frauds and other scams. More familiar than most with The First Age and well capable of defending yourself, you managed to avoid being taken in by any of them (or worse).
		.   As you learned to recognize more reputable shops and merchants, you found yourself one afternoon perusing a shop's collection of books and scrolls while the shopkeeper spoke with another patron. A book caught your eye, the fifth in a series of guidebooks to The Old Realm, written in it's tongue. The _fifth_, in fact, in a supposedly complete series of _four_, all four of which your monastery had retained copies of.
		.   You called to the shopkeep, asking him what this covered, if it's author had claimed to have set down all he knew of the world in his previous four volumes. It was the other figure that responded, though, saying that it was an _update_, and very useful in his work. He introduced himself as Silver-Tongued Rishi and explained that the author had lived to see the end of The First Age, publishing another volume discussing the changes he had since witnessed in the world.
		.   You confessed you had read the first four, but had been not been aware there was a fifth. It was far less widely published, Rishi explained, in the chaos that closed out the age. Rishi insisted on making a gift of the volume to you, asking only that you meet with him at a later date, after reading it, to discuss certain sections he suspected were later fabrications. Walking you out of the shop, he also seemed to take note of your reaction to his bodyguards, when they fell in around Rishi as he walked out into the street, how you took a defensive stance and the way you looked them over.
		.   After your second meeting with Rishi, where you discussed the book and evaded questions about your education, he offered you a job, explaining that he was a scavenger lord and could alway use more scholars who could read the tongue of The Old Realm, especially ones willing to work out in the field. You were delighted to accept, given your mission. When he introduced you to the first of a particular four others in his employ, people somehow both very strange and very familiar to you, you knew you were indeed where you were supposed to be, and at the true beginning of your journey.

	Who is your family and where are they (and no, no dead familys!) And how do they support themselves?
	---------------------------------
		(Oops. Went deep into a dead family direction long before that prohibition, but it's all part of a suitable surrogate group.)
		.   You were one of the many foundlings taken in by The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon over the centuries. It is how they've propogated their order since the end of The First Age. You were raised by it's disciplined tenets to become a humble monk, guarding the manse of the order's long gone master.
		.   When your Exaltation came as a teenager, you went from expectations of humbleness to the venerated center of attention, heir to the manse, it's treasures, and the service of the order of monks. After that, your education continued to focus on martial arts and occult secrets, but the specifics changed dramatically. Ancient tomes, painstakingly copied again and again over the centuries, were brought forth and you learned the techniques of the Solar Exalted. Your teachers, once harsh authority figures, were now obsequious, but no less infuriating, as you underwent a sorcerous initiation prescribed many centuries ago by your predecessor.
		.   You once had dim memories of your mother, a farm on which you lived, and the morning when she would not awake. After that, you had impressions of hunger, and eventually of a stranger that took you away from there, leaving you in a nearby village, only a few years old. The monk who found you there, bringing you to the order, told you that stranger had done you a favor, though not a large one. If so, the monk did you a far greater one, in bringing you to the monastery and also in retelling to you the circumstances in which you were found whenever he stopped there on his traveling rounds. Those retellings are now all you have left of your life before the monastery, as the memories of your life before, the memories that kept you up at night, wondering what was and what could have been, were what you sacrificed in your sorcerous initiation. You'd press that monk again for details, as you had again and again for years, but, when you were eleven and before your Exaltation, he did not return from his rounds when expected, and was never seen again.
		.   The monastery and it's order are the only home you really have, and they're very dear to you. You may lament their foibles, but that doesn't change that they're home and family to you.

	Finally, what is one cultural tradition you follow? Roughly greek or japanese style, like praying or leaving offerings at shrines, bathing daily, refraining from eating specific things, dressing a certain way, shaving your head, that kind of thing.
	---------------------------------
		.   You dress in loose, flowing clothing, and keep your head shaved. Both are marks of your upbringing in The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon. While the former retains practical benefits for you, the latter had been a strict requirement of the members of the order, novices and monks alike, a symbol of their humility. You suppose you no longer _need_ to keep your head shorn, but you've grown used to it, and it quickly bothers you if left to grow out.
	(In the course of writing up the above, I swapped my two dots in War for a dot in Investigate and a second dot in Lore. It seemed to both make this character more Twilight-flavored, vs. the original Dawn caste, and to better suit his increasingly fleshed out back story and relationship with Rishi. I hope that's OK!)


4/26/21:
	-Sounds like I've had a dream, as now recorded in my character sheet in Roll20 too:
		-"Dreams of the first age: you remember standing in a circle of power surrounded by Elementals kneeling in prostration. They offer you Porcelan masks each bearing the inscription of a name, you know these contain the sould of your favored servants, who sacrificed their bodies to serve forever. you know the magic used to create these were your greatest accomplishment."
	-We've all been summoned to Rishi's estate.
		-One of his runner's came to collect me.
		-Rishi's estate is right on the border of the Firewander district's wyld zone.
			-It's walled and surrounded by four white jade pillars from which prayer banners dangle,
			 stabilizing the area.
	-Rishi always goes about wrapped in bandages, and is said to be disfigured beneath it.
		-Some name him "Clayface", as the tale is that one of the Fae had disfigured, molding his
		 body like clay.
	-Hawk invariably wears fine, shining plate. His skin is pale, making the contrast with his bright
	 blue eyes all the more dramatic.
	-Rishi has a proposal for us.
		-Recently, a trio of death knights were killed within the city's borders.
		-They were carrying something important, and came to meet another death knight.
			-The other is in service to "The Walker in Darkeness".
		-So much necrotic energy in one area attracted the attention of sorcerers.
			-Lord Hilo, who resides in the Cinnabar district, is rumored to be the one who carried
			 out the attack on them.
		-The lone remaining death knight is said to hold information leading to an ancient manse.
			-Rishi wishes us to look into this. If it bears fruit, he will give us each a half talen
			 of jade (equivalent of Resources 3). If not, he'll give us half that (Resources 2).
			-Rishi must not be implicated, though, as he and Hylo share an ally who would be wroth
			 if Rishi were discovered working against Hilo.
	-We made our introductions while enjoying Rishi's food, and then headed to The East Canal to
	 take a gondola to The Cinnabar District.
		-Once outside of Firewander, where wyld mutant attacks are less of a concern, the buildings
		 grew nicer and nicer, even giving way to many surviving First Age buildings.
		-By the time we debarked, the very cobblestones in the street seemed polished and without
		 flaw.
		-In the sky above, we could see the silver-masked Emissary watching over the city below.
	-We headed to the general location in which we were told Lord Hilo's estate was to be found.
		-We saw guards standing outside one building, quite similar to those that guard the slave
		 pits.
			-The bore a device on their shield, a cracked tower atop a mountain, the emblem of the
			 "Broken Tower Family", a noble family in the scavenger lands.
				-They have a dark reputation, and are said to have ties to organized crime.
		-We wracked our brains for an option for talking our way inside.
			-Libak suggested a name, Diban of the Northern Wolves, a slaver who recently drank
			 himself to death, a thing not yet widely known.
			-We approached the guards and Libak claim himself to be a representative of Diban.
			-They bought the story, and allowed us in.
	-A dark tunnel led into Hilo's estate.
		-Golden Blade lit a torch, as the oil lamps that were installed in much of the city
		 seem to be missing down here.
		-We could hear skittering in the darkness outside of the radius of our light. . .
		-Heading down the tunnel, we reached a part that was barricaded by a crude wall of
		 trash.
		-Turning back and down another branch, the passage dead ended at three valves, two hot
		 and in good repair, while the third was rusted and chained in place with a lock.
			-Silent Onyx was able to figure out the puzzle lock, and removed the chain.
			-Turning it probably wasn't the wisest thing we could of done, as the tunnel behind
			 us then began to fill with steam reeking of rotten eggs.
			-Pip called for us to extinguish our torches, and then illuminated her caste mark!
				-(Another) Solar Exalted! An Eclipse caste.
		-Holding our breath, we ran through the foul steam, thankfully unharmed.
			-Hearing more skittering, Libak too illuminated a (Zenith) caste mark)!
		-Golden Blade burst that barricade, revealing another cloud of gas behind it.
			-We're thinking it's the gas meant to fuel the missing lamps.
		-Golden Blade thought he saw something moving in the cloud ahead of us. . .
		-Pip loosed an arrow into the gas, and was greeted with a chorus of shrieks.
		-The subsequent thrashing cleared much of the gas revealing a tangled swarm of rats,
		 still shrieking, and moving as if one mass.
			-Quick as a serpant, I darted forward, pulping three of the rats with my fists.
			-Silent Onyx joined me, cutting down more of the rats, until the swarm moved no more.
			-Onyx had heard stories when he was younger about "mythical" rat kings that live beneath
			 Nexus.
		-Continuing on, we came to a great, though awful smelling, chamber.
			-It featured a pool and several valves, but we left these well enough alone.
		-Heading North down the tunnel leading from that chamber, we came to a crossroads and
		 turned left.
		-It took us to a chamber with a door that _could_ have been concealed, built as it was
		 with clever mechanisms that would close flush with the wall, but it was partly open.
			-Inside was a ladder leading upwards, to some kind of large cave.
			-Within the cave, a fortress had been constructed.
				-Very fitting for a criminal citadel, and in line with what we were told of
				 Hilo's estate.
				-Torch and glowing clusters of quartz ("glowstones") lit the cavern as if by
				 moonlight.
				-We resolved to split up for a bit, most of us continuing the pretense of being
				 emissaries from Diban, while Silent Onyx scaled the walls of the castle, hoping
				 to have a stealthy look around.
		-A guard answered our knock and allowed the remaining four of us into the fortress, after
		 we told him we were a delegation from Diban.
			-He asked that we leave our weapons at a room near the entrance, which the others
			 complied with while I indicated I was unarmed.
		-The guard then led us into an audience with Lord Hilo, who was watching a jester while a
		 geisha mixed a drink and a samurai with a white-jade powerbow stood guard.
			-Libak claimed we represented Diban, and announced that he sought information on a manse,
			 offering goods or coin in exchange.
			-Hilo sent away his fool and geisha, and then asked us where we'd heard he possessed
			 such information.
			-Libak told him the things we'd heard concerning the the fight with the death knights.
			-Lord Hilo again demanded that we tell him who we worked for, but Libak said now that
			 our employer did not wish to be named.
			-Hilo seemed a bit taken aback that we were somewhat upfront about that, but he asked us
			 to tell him we at least did not work for a death knight.
				-While he did so, his eyes rippled, and water. . . _emerged_ from them, hanging there.
					-To me, it seemed like some Terrestrial Charm.
					-Perhaps to discern truth? He had _each_ of us disclaim death knight employment.
				-We all did so.
			-He asked what we offered in payment, for this valueable information.
				-Libak rambled off several options, including _service_.
				-Service seemed to catch his attention, and he dismissed his guards, including the
				 samurai, who smelled strongly of freshly turned earth as he walked past us.
				-Hilo emphasized again the great value of this information, talking of those who
				 fell in battle against the death knights, including his son-in-law.
				-Hilo wanted _vengeance_, the remaining death knight dead, but he hides in Nexus's
				 Wyld Zone, where none of his men would venture.
					-Mutation is likely, if we do, though there are ways to guard against it and
					 other hazards of the wild. Rishi, in fact, is known for such things.
				-We asked Lord Hilo what he could tell us of the death knight.
					-He described the monster to us, masked in a terrible shrieking deathmask of
					 black metal and always wrapped in strips of black leather, but said that was
					 all that he knew.
					-Golden Blade claimed that he was lying about that last bit. He's keeping
					 something from us.
					-Libak attempted to shame him on that score, as we had, afterall, been as honest
					 as we could be, but his efforts were in vain.
					-We accepted the deal, and took our leave of him.
		-As we left, Silent Onyx soon joined us, jumping down from the walls after we crossed the
		 drawbridge.
			-We returned to Rishi's, and then we caught each other up.
				-Rishi, though, had gone somewhere with Hawk, and had been unsure how long he'd be
				 gone.
			-Silent Onyx told us the rooms above seemed far too empty, though Golden Blade pointed
			 out that there _was_ supposed to be a funeral going on, which may explain it.
			-He also had found an ear with strangely regular markings.
				-I was able to interpret the code. It stated that, "If others of my circle should
				 find this, let The Mask know I have failed."
				-Golden Blade suggested this may be The Mask of Winters, who rules Thorns.
				-Death knights are the vanguards of the armies of the death lords. They're rather
				 Solar-like.
					-Golden Blade had even encountered one, and it had a caste mark, though it
					 glowed _red_.
					-They're murderers, and definitely not folks we want to deliver a message for.


-TODO:
	-Figure out how we might enter the wild.
		-Tougher than otherwise, with Rishi gone, but Nexus isn't a bad place to research the
		 subject.
	-Figure out if you should let the others know you're a Solar.
		-Pip (Eclipse) and Libak (Zenith) have both illuminated their marks, and Golden Blade (Dawn)
		 has been open about it with the Hawke and his employees, such that you could easily find out.
		-Perhaps raise it at the beginning of next session, roleplaying a tentative reveal?
	-Have your motes all come back?
		-Even an hour at Rishi's would would more than suffice.


5/10/21:
	-Back at Rishi's estate, we discussed our next moves.
		-I'd already worked with Rishi for a bit, and have access to his library, but it's more
		 focused on First Age remnants than The Wyld.
		-Libak suggested that the city's library may hold more.
		-Silent Onyx was more in favor of throat cutting, returning to Hilo's estate and taking the
		 information we need from corpses.
		-I also, playing a bit dumb, asked Libak and Pip what those symbol's they displayed in the
		 sewers were.
			-Libak all but admitted to being a Solar Exalted.
			-I cautioned them to keep such things under wraps, particularly in light of Lord Hilo
			 and one of his attendants being dragonborn.
	-We opted to head to the City Library, to further research the hazards of The Wyld.
		-It's one of Nexus's First Age structures, comprised of the usual white harder-than-marble
		 and much gilt.
		-They had a whole section covering The Wyld, but when Golden Blade asked about books
		 that might tell us more about The Mask of Winters, the attendant said there was little,
		 though he did mention there were many works on ghosts in general.
		-We headed to The Wyld section, and began reading through what was available.
			-It took us a couple of hours, but we managed to confirm that iron against our skin
			 would indeed protect us, but also that Exalted have varying degrees of resistance to
			 the energies of The Wyld.
			-Short excursions into Wyld Zones bordering creation might be largely safe for a Solar
			 Exalted.
			-As a border march, Nexus's Wyld Zone is relatively constant. It has been covered by an
			 eternal thunderstorm for the last thousand years, and is filled with rain washed First
			 Age ruins.
				-The lightening blasted ruins are a strange contrast to the still immaculate First
				 Age buildings in the rest of Nexus.
		-We were also curious about the general properties of ghosts, in the name of sizing up The
		 Mask of Winters to some extent.
			-Golden Blade, in particular.
			-Exorcists deal with ghosts via the thaumaturgical Art of Exorcism, but they can also
			 be locked in a ring of salt, and exposure to true daylight will destroy them.
				-The Mortician's Guild of Sijan are famed exorcists, though far from here.
	-We then sought out our wrought iron, heading to the market district.
		-We procured for ourselves a set of wrought iron rings.
		-Thinking of the rain, we also picked up a set of hooded lanterns.
	-We then returned to Rishi's estate to rest, before setting out.
	-Late that night, just before midnight, we heard the sound of Rishi's return.
		-Crashing noises and shouting called us from our rooms on the estate, and we saw a very
		 drunk Hawke and Rishi.
		-Hawke was throttling Rishi, demanding he "take it back!"
			-He claimed Rishi had called him a coward, and threw Rishi to the ground.
		-Rishi said that Hawke, "is a mean drunk! I told you we should have stayed away from that
		 devil rum!"
		-Golden Blade did a solid job of defusing the situation by asking if they'd brought any of
		 the rum back (lol).
		-He and Hawke set to drinking, while Libak helped Rishi back to his room.
			-Pretty soon, Hawke was passed out on a bench and could not be moved.
	-The next morning, we were waken by servants with breakfast.
		-Hawke too, who seemed none to thrilled by the wake up.
		-Rishi, by contrast, was already up, painting a psychedelic female nude.
			-Apparently it's his mom, who had a dream about last night.
			-She was one of the fae.
	-An odd coincidence, I said, and told him of the deal Lord Hilo offered.
		-Rishi indeed knew the Wyld well, and had an offer of help, though for one of us only.
		-He had a servant bring forth a white jade torc, which he said would maintain a zone of
		 stability around the wearer in the zone.
			-We opted to give the torc to Silent Onyx, who would be well suited to scouting the
			 zone, to minimize the time we need spend in there unprotected.
		-He also warned us to avoid the golden dome inside. No bordermarch, within, Rishi said,
		 lay pure chaos.
	-Silent Onyx set out into the zone, while we waited in Rishi's estate, right on it's border.
		-A short time after he left, we saw a great bolt of lightening above the golden dome, which
		 turned into a flaming chariot.
		-Soon after, plants began to grow all around the zone, twisting into enormous monsters that
		 began to wander the zone.
			-Silent Onyx needed help.
		-I ran to my room, to gather my things, and to also cast Wood Dragon's Claw. Then, drawing
		 my arms into the sleeves of my cloak, I returned to the others, and we set out into the
		 zone.
	-The moment we stepped into the Wyld Zone, we were somehow swiftly drawn further into the zone.
		-It was as if we were torn from a painting, dragged further in, with the local scenery coming
		 with.
		-We then heard a voice, speaking of heroes who went to save their comrade, but who were beset
		 by monsters. We _saw_ the monsters, but they seemed somehow unreal. Or, at least, to all of
		 us save Pip, who flailed beneath their immaterial blows, as one snatched away one of her
		 possessions, a staff.
		-In the distance, we saw Silent Onyx, but he was knocked into the air by a blast, thrown out
		 of the zone.
		-We ran towards him, but again heard the voice. It spoke of the heroes rushing to their
		 friend's side, but also of a golem that would not let them bass.
		-Sure enough, a 15' tall humanoid figure of rough hewn glass barred our way, blocking us no
		 matter how we tried to circle around it.
		-No way out but through, then, so I cast another spell, Invulnerable Skin of Bronze.
		-With that, my anima flared, a blazing pillar of light.
			-Guess the circle knows I'm a solar now.
		-That provoked a reaction from the voice, which spoke of a "daikaiju" that struck me down,
		 grinding my flesh to paste.
			-Uh oh.
			-The golem than struck me with a mighty blow, smashingly me into a cartoonishly me-shaped
			 hole in the pavement.
			-My sorcerously fortified skin seems to have saved me, though, as I climbed out of the
			 hole unharmed.
		-A beautiful golden figure then descended from the clouds, a horned woman.
			-She said that I was "worthy", able to stand before the strongest of her "daikaiju".
			-She said it had been a very long time since such heroes had entered her realm.
				-"Oh?", I asked, "For we came seeking another who hides here."
				-"The Mistress? Emissary of The Mask of Winters?"
				-"That sounds like the one."
			-She then offered a deal. She said she had tested The Mistress, but found her wanting,
			 and took her heart. She offered it to me, in exchange for swearing myself her enemy
			 until the end of time.
				-"One day, my armies shall issue forth, slaughtering all before them. You will
				 stand in opposition to my monsters."
				-How could I do otherwise than stand against such a tide? I accepted the deal, taking
				 from the golden figure a red crystal wrapped in barbed wire and thorned vines.
				-I took it with one of my clawed hands, and immediately became intensely aware of
				 the Death Knight. She felt angry. . . but helpless.
			-To Onyx, she offered a deal as well, desiring his hate. In exchange, he was given a 
			 scroll, one that seemed to contain a spell from the glance I saw, and also the promise
			 of a grisly death at her hands.
			-Things seemed to have gone more or less well, but Pip was quite aggrieved by the loss
			 of her staff, an item the figure was all too happy taunt her with, after she mentioned
			 it.
				-She offered it's return, in exchange for Pip's heart (a rather poor deal).
				-Impetuously, Golden Blade proposed a duel instead, for the staff, which the figure
				 gladly accepted. He will duel a kaiju.


-TODO:
	-Ask the golden figure her name.
		-"I must know the name of my new enemy, the name I will curse and swear vendetta against!"
		-Done: "The Mother Horrors, Muse of War, The Eternal Darkness That Will Blanket Creation."


5/24/21: Golden Blade vs. Kaiju!
	-I asked Lesley about how the world views the fey-descended, like Rishi: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/846489725824270354
		-Not the condemnation that Solars face, so probably not a case of mutually assured
		 destruction between the two of us, as I'd been hoping.
		-Nonetheless, they're feared and reviled, a people generally believe they fey want to eat
		 their souls.
	-The faerie began discussing the terms of the duel.
		-Her terms: "We will fight without shaping magics."
		-Golden Blade's: "We will fight on solid ground."
		-Her next: "You shall wear no iron during the combat."
			-Golden Blade was. . . less than enthusiastic about that one.
				-"You should talk with my attorney," he said, and Libak stepped in to argue.
				-Libak tapped his staff, calling attention to himself, and launched into an argument
				 that this proposal was _not_, in fact, fair!
					-As he did so, he slowly began to glow. . . 
					-Looks like _all_ of us five are Solars! (Who'd've thought?!?)
				-The fay agreed, but demanded in exchange that Blade then not be allowed to use
				 weapons.
				-Libak talked her into an alternate offer: "If you must have your weapon, than I
				 shall be allowed sorcery."
				-That we assented to, so her final term was no god or Wyld gifts.
					-Instead, Libak countered with an offer that Blade instead not attack for the
					 first three rounds, to which she assented.
				-Silent Onyx got frustrated with all the waiting and took the complacent deathknight
				 out of the zone with him, back to his home in Nexus.
					-I'm pretty confident I can follow the heart back to them.
		-With that, the terms of the contest were settled.
			-The golden figure instructed the rest of us to stand back, as she hereself drew back to
			 a nearyby rooftop.
			-I had a question, though: "I must know the name of my new enemy, the name I will curse
			 and swear vendetta against, and the name I shall root against here."
				-The Mother of Horrors, Muse of War, The Eternal Darkness That Will Blanket Creation.
			-Blade then set about battling the kaiju champion.
				-He seemingly had it defeated when it dissolved into a cloud of obsidian butterflies,
				 only to reform in the air above.
					-I noticed an amethyst butterfly among them, one that seemed to carry the spell
					 into the sky.
					-Pip, though, called The Mother of Horrors out, saying she had deceived us, and
					 was herself engaged in the battle. She winced at each blow, and lines of
					 essence formed on her body.
						-The two of them, along with Libak, then engaged in a philosophical debate
						 about whether that's cheating or not.
						-Things finally clicked for me (I finally rolled half decent on Int+Occult)
						 and I realized that, despite no more visible wounds, it could not heal the
						 blows a creature of Creation that easily and, futher, that the iron may be
						 a better weapon than the blade.
						-I shouted reassurances to Golden Blade that he had this, and told him to use
						 the iron.
					-Ringed punches didn't go so well, but Golden Blade bent the ring over his sword
					 and then made short work of the kaiju.
					-Enraged, Golden Blade then strode towards the faerie.
						-"If the kaiju was you, you're in this!"
						-At that, she called the staff to her hand and threw it down, admitting
						 defeat.
						-Golden Blade was not appeased, though. . .
							-I shrugged at the thought of my new enemy's demise, but Pip and Libak
							 ran to intervene.
							-Libak broke Blade's charge, thowing himself between him and the fay,
							 while Pip even struck his blade with an arrow, attempting to disarm
							 him.
							-They set to arguing, and the fay took to the opportunity to dissolve
							 into goo and disappear, promising to one day rip off Golden Blade's
							 limbs as she went.
	-Well, that was pretty much a success!
		-Garn said as much as we walked back out of the Wyld zone.
		-As we reached the barriers at it's edges, the white stones, I could feel some. . . resistance
		 as I pulled the heart-crystal through the barrier with me.
		-We exited where we entered, at the edge of Rishi's estate.
	-I found I no longer had a sense of the deathknight's location, but the "heart" tugged at my
	 essence, not unlike my artifact bracers. I could attune to this.
		-Finding an available room at Rishi's estate, I took 20 minutes to attune a mote to the
		 artifact.
		-I was then beset by visions, visions in which I was her.
			-Falling in a hail of arrows on a battlefield.
			-A masked figure, skull-faced and befeathered, with another mask on the back of it's
			 head, offering her a quill, with which she signed something.
				-The Mask of Winters.
			-Another of her leading an army of undead, towards the Marukani Foothills.
			-Finally, her weeping tears of blood, as the fay reached down her throat and tore out
			 this heart.
		-Then attuned, for 1 mote committed, I could again feel a pull towards the deathknight.
			-I also could sense more options, were I to pour a bit, a moderate amount, or a lot.
		-I relayed the visions to the others, and Golden Blade recognized the army as a force
		 involved in the conquest of Thorns.
			-History, then. Comforting, as an undead army on the march near my manse would be cause
			 for grave alarm.
		-We flagged down a rickshaw, following the tug I felt to the Sentinel's Hill district.
			-The rickshaw for a badly beat Blade's comfort.
			-Winding through it's streets, we came to a warehouse with apartments above.
			-Golden Blade had called for a victory drink on the ride over, and a pub on the corner
			 was calling our names, so I suggested he and I go grab some drinks to go while Libak
			 and Pip ask around to see if anyone knows where Onyx lives.
		-By the time Golden Blade and I had a jug of unspecified booze, the others were nowhere to
		 be seen, but we could hear voices inside the warehouse.
			-I called out, and they came out to collect us.
		-Inside, Silent Onyx had apparently been torturing the deathknight, though to no avail as
		 she only stared, glassy eyed.
			-I tried the first, smallest expenditure of essence (2 motes) fed to the heart, and found
			 myself looking out from her eyes, moving her hands instead of mine.
			-Attempting the second, 5 motes, she was briefly lucid, and answered one question, when
			 I asked her name.
				-The Mistress of Pacts Sealed in Blood.
				-She seemed greatly distressed, with a single tear rolling down her cheek.
			-Finally, with the expenditure of 10 motes, she became somewhat more independently lucid.
				-A bit worrying, and she did indeed express a desire to murder the lot of us, but
				 said she could not raise her hand to do so.
					-The tears continued at this.
				-Now, she was answering multiple questions and volunteering information.
				-She told us she came here to meet with the other three deathknights and pool
				 information with them.
					-The others were Shoat of the Mire, Endless Apostate Fed to the Wolves, and The
					 Dowager, the last actually being a _deathlord_.
				-Some letters had been discovered to the far North, of interest to her master, The
				 Mask of Winters.
					-Old love letters, they also concerned a manse, somehow removed from Creation,
					 hidden in the shadow of it's own Essence.
					-Her master had known the author.
					-Sounds like what we were looking for.
				-The dragonborn had been indirect in their assault on the deathknights, though, out
				 of fear for the Abyssals and used catapults and trebuchets to collapse the building
				 they were in.
					-She claimed (and believed, according to Libak's charm) that the letters were
					 surely destroyed, but that she held the information still, in her mind.
					-Though she said she was powerless to deny it to us, she still asked that, in
					 exchange for the information, we free her, and that she would do us no harm in
					 return, traveling far from here (again, the truth).
					-We ended the session there.


TODO:
	-Oh! To decide what to do with our death knight, I can ask her about herself!
		-I've already seen a vision of what could very accurately be construed as a dire crime,
		 leading that undead army on Thorns.
			-This is also something you can look into elsewhere, asking Golden Blade or around Nexus
			 what exactly happened at Thorns.
	-_Is_ this the death knight Hilo sent us after? Don't know that she sounds like the description.
		-Search "We asked Lord Hilo what he could tell us of the death knight"


6/21/21:
	-We need to know more about the Abyssals.
		-A 4 on Int+Lore told me:
			-Reports of these "deathknights" first began around the fall of Thorns.
			-They largely lived up to the reputation of the "Anathema" all Solars are said to be.
			-The serve powerful ghosts, called "deathlords".
				-Two deathlords known by name in Nexus are The Mask of Winters and The Walker in
				 Darkness.
				-They've raised small armies in the past, to test the defenses of Nexus.
	-We then asked The Mistress about the letters.
		-They were love letters between a Solar and his Lunar lover.
			-Written by Ozandus Pal to the wolf-beast Mithra.
				-Our destination on the map lies in "Mithra's Domain", but you're not certain that's
				 the name you heard Lesley say.
		-They also spoke of the manse, the last wonder by Kalbax, the very one who had worked on the
		 imperial manse.
			-Within is the body of The Walker in Darkness.
				-When asked what her master intended to do with it, she said it's rumored that only
				 with their body could a deathlord be truely destroyed.
			-Shoat of the Mire, one of the other deathknights, had a map from his patron, leading to
			 the manse, but it could not be decoded without information from the letters.
				-She claimed to possess a eiditic memory, and having seen them, was able to replicate
				 them for us, given paper.
					-She did so with some kind of (literally) bloody charm.
				-It pointed to a location far to the Northeast, a place along the river there, known
				 as Wangler's Knob.
					-It's some 3000 miles away, though.
			-Asked if this could indeed find us the manse, she warned us it's near undetectable but
			 that, following the path, we would eventually arrive at it.
	-We're rather unsure what to do about her.
		-We do seem inclined to hold onto her for the moment, until this manse is really in hand.
		-A lengthy expedition to the far Northeast makes it. . . complicated to leave her somewhere.
	-We wanted to talk to Rishi about his next move, so headed to Rishi's estate, leaving her at
	 Onyx's for the moment.
		-When we arrived, Hawke was there too, with 5 of his soldiers, talking to Rishi out front.
		-One of the street facing windows of the estate was broken.
		-Asking if everything was OK, Rishi ushered us inside, telling us that things had become more
		 complicated.
		-Inside, Hawke asked Rishi if he was _sure_ that Hilo was not responsible for the assassin. . .
			-No, Rishi told him the man bore the markings of The Guild.
		-Rishi _did_ seem concerned about Hilo, though. He had heard rumors that Hilo might possess
		 information leading to a cache of First Age artifacts, presumably the manse we seek.
			-He may sell it to another party, perhaps even The Guild.
		-We told Rishi, though, that we, at least, certainly did have the information.
			-We went inside and unfurled the map, and told him of Wangler's Knob.
			-We then began discussions of outfitting a ship.
				-He suggested that we disappear in the meantime, getting out of the city.
					-He'd be doing the same, and best none of us can reveal the other.
				-Rishi said a ship bearing yellow crosses on the prow would be ready in a week at the
				 Nighthammer docks, and would wait only another week if we are late.
	-We then swung by Hawke's estate to get Golden Blade patched up, and then back to Onyx's to
	 discuss our next move.
		-I largely had the circle convinced to disappear to a town I knew of, not far from the manse.
		-We headed to the docks in persuit of that, seeking a boat to take us a short distance West,
		 before heading South overland towards Marukan.
			-I handed the heart off to Pip as we left, as I was short on motes, and we needed her
			 cooperation.
		-Reaching the docks, though, with a cloaked deathknight in tow, we found no _immediately_
		 convenient boat, and many of the party got very interested in convenient ships to Great
		 Forks.
			-We eventually agreed I'd set out on my own, claiming "business to attend to" and "family
			 in the hills".
			-Great Forks turned out to be party town, with every day a raucous celebration honoring a
			 different god. I missed out. :(
	-Meanwhile, I made my way home.
		-The mortician's were happy to help, in exchange only for 2 dinars towards an
		 unfortunate's burial costs.
			-We picked up corpses at a ruined fort accross the river, many branded with the
			 symbol marking The Mask of Winter's spies.
			-At an inlet along the Yanaze, they stopped to receive corpses raised up from the
			 river by fish and lobster people, their mouths, noses, and eyes packed with salt,
			 paying in silver coin for their burial.
			-I took my leave of them there, scaling the high cliffs of the river bank there
			 via some rickety ladders leading up from the inlet, heading South towards home.
		-Along the way overland, I saw a great, rainbow light, to the South past the hills.
		-Arriving, finally and exhausted, at the mance, I greeted my monks, and only
		 companions for most of my life.
			-They informed me that a strange beast, coming East from Mishaka, had attacked the manse.
				-Some sort of elemental or god, it had the skull of an elk for a head, long, clawed
				 arms on it's tiny frame, and split ribs revealing the cavity it's heart should have
				 been. It seemed to be fond of flaying.
				-They were able to defeat it, but only with the help of _another_ visitor, a red caped 
				 swordsman who arrived as it did.
				-Their memories of the swordsman were strangely clouded, though. They could not
				 remember his name or features.
			-The violation of the sacred manse was profoundly troubling.
			-I had, though, good news for them, telling them of the potential first age cache I am on
			 the trail of.
			-I warned them, though, that I'd also be gone a long while, off in search of it.
		-After resting the night of my arrival, I set about doing what I came to, and learned a new
		 spell, Spoke the Wooden Face.
			-Choosen, in part, in reaction to the intrusion.
			-I unfortunately cannot take the contents of my library from the manse, inscribed as it
			 is on strange crystal tablets, useable only within the manse's boundaries. This spell
			 also resolves that, as I can have my monks hold them up to the tree.
			-I did indeed perform one casting of the spell, having had my monks uproot and pot a small
			 tree from within the manse's grounds. It can now be moved inside as needed.
		-I eventually took my leave of the manse, and headed North again, overland.
			-On the way, in the distance ahead, I saw a red caped figure.
				-Red themed in general.
			-Striding towards him, I did fall into Snake Form and engage my Essence Fangs
			 and Scales Technique, but then greeted him.
				-He greeted me as "Master of the Fort", and asked me, "Do you know that you
				 are destined to fight in a great battle?"
				-I acknowledged that I was indeed raised to believe a great fate lay before
				 me.
				-He said that, at the end of the battle, when fate becomes cloudy, and many
				 things are possible, that I would encounter a great darkness.
				-It may be that I release the great darkness upon the land, but there is also
				 some chance I may master it, building a great empire of gold.
				-He also spoke of a great plague in the land and, as he walked away, shouted
				 one last time: "Beware the birds."
		-The remainder of the trip back to Nexus was uneventful.
			-I was able to catch a ride with a fisherman, in exchange for work.
			-A independent garum making operation, it was a smelly last leg of the journey,
			 but Garn is not oppose to turning his hands to labor.
	-Upon reuniting with the party, I told them my journey had been gnomic and smelly.
		-Theirs, they told me, was quite literally a party, save a strange encounter on the trip home.
		-A boat full of pirates delivered them a dramatic message, tossing a scroll aboard that said,
		 "Beware the birds."
		-At that, I started, and revealed that I too had receieved a similar message.
		-We soon figured out their boat also held a red caped figure. It seems we perhaps encountered
		 the same person.
		-Or, perhaps, _creature_, given his strange appearance and the powers he displayed.
			-With an Occult roll, I thought there was lots of things he could have been. A little god,
			 a fairy in disguise, a demon. . .
		-I relayed to them the contents of my own, more detailed warning.
	-With me finally aboard, we quickly set out, aboard four ships.
		-We took the ships down river, past Sijan.
		-Passing a great forest on the right bank, we heard strange and terrifying noises coming from
		 the forest. Screams, screechs, and sometimes the sound of battle.
		-As three of the ships steered towards the left, looking to take aboard more fresh water, the
		 fourth instead slowly veered to the right, running aground on the forested side's bank.
			-What the hell were they doing? Pip shouted to the crew of our own ship, aided by a charm,
			 ordering them to follow and rescue them.
			-As we arrived on the right bank, we saw the ships crew, slowly walking into the forest.
			-Golden Blade shouted to them. Only one of them turned, though, and his face was largely
			 torn away. He simply stood there, chittering strangely.
			-I said that I suspect the crew was beyond saving. . .
			-What though of the soldier, below deck? We ran to the ship, opening one of the hatches.
			-In response, we heard shouts that, "They're coming back! Get back in the circle!"
			-We shouted that it was us, not whatever became of the crew.
			-One of the soldiers had apparently been a veteran of Thorns, and knew the hungry dead
			 could not cross salt. He scattered it in a circle about his fellows.
			-We lead the shaken soldiers onto our own ship, and headed on.
	-A few days more down the river, one of the sailors was lighting a cookfire on a metal plate on
	 deck, heating some water, only for the cookpot to suddenly grow to many times it's size, and a
	 nude, incredibly hairy, Danny Devito looking man with an enormous dick emerged.
		-"Cooking military rations, eh? I love military boys!"
		-He claimed to be the god of manly challenges, and cookfires, and asked who'd face him in a
		 drinking contest! If we could best him, he'd bless our cookpots to alway produce delicious
		 food, and ask nothing should he win.
			-Golden Blade was game, and the god soon hauled an enormous cask of liquor from the
			 cookpot.
			-Golden Blade, with some Willpower, pulled off a shocking victory, and the god was as
			 good as his word. The next batch of rations from the pot tasted _fantastic_.
	-Further down the river, moving into the realm of the Linowan, the river grew more and more
	 crowded.
		-As we arrived at the town of Wangler's Knob, in addition to the Iriquois-looking Linowan,
		 we saw evidence of a presence from The Realm. We saw the markings of House Cessus, and
		 Realm legionnaires walking around.
		-Docking, Pip apparently noticed someone she recognized on the docks.
			-Apparently she had admitted to the captain of the vessel they returned from Great Forks
			 on that she was a Solar Exalted, with a poor reaction on his part.
			-The captain saw her too, and disappeared into the crowded streets. Shit.
			-I was less than thrilled by this, especially given the Realm presence here.
			-She ran off, claiming she'll talk to him.
		-Meanwhile, we went to confer with Rishi, about our next step.
			-He had negotiated with the harbor master for some space near the docs to setup shop.
			-There, inside a tent, we got some time alone with him, as he poured over books on the
			 Linowan, the Halta, and fragments of First Age records.
			-He too was concerned by the unusually far out Realm presence, fearing they came for what
			 we seek.
			-He suggested we seek information on their presence, noting they would likely deal largely
			 with diplomats and the town's governor.
				-That was well within Libak's remit, and we got to it, asking around town
				-The name Taltoc came up, a former soldier who's said to be working with the dynasts.
					-Members of The Wyld Hunt are said to be in the area hunting a monster that had
					 been terrorizing the area, The Wendigo.
				-Miles Wangler is the current governor, but he's rumored to be getting strong armed
				 by Sesus Lahor, who's pushing for more and more concessions to the dynasts.
				-The Madam is another power in town, amongst the tents rather than the nobles'
				 longhouses. She seems to be seeking some kind of workers' rebellion, against the
				 nobles and tradors, and she is said to have a blue robed servant, with a white sparrow
				 stitched on his breast, that terrorizes the town.
					-She herself is supposedly Dragonblooded.
			-Well, that at least suggests they're not (yet) here for us or the manse.
			-We returned to Rishi, to share this.
				-They'd heard some of the same.
				-Rishi termed the city a powder keg, and Hawke suggested leaving it, but Rishi warned
				 against that, saying the wilderness around us feature several Wyld Zones, and that it
				 would be best to stay within the city's wards againt the fay.
				-Rishi suggested we'd best scout ahead, attracting less attention than moving in force.
					-I asked that, in finding it, what should we do? Send for him?
					-He offered up a jade disk, one of a pair. Speaking through the whole in the center
					 of one disks, his voice echoed forth from the other.
					-I claimed it.
				-We were happy to agree, and began gathering supplies, leaving off there for the night.
			-Oh, on Pip's return, she offered only faint reassurance that our. . . nature was still
			 unknown here. She _did_ see the captain with a legionnaire.


TODO:
	-Uh, that Abyssal is still with us, right? Didn't really come up on the boat trip, but what are
	 we going to do with her as we now set out.
		-I don't think we could have managed to keep her a secret on the boat either.

7/12/21:
	-We resolved my TODO above, about the Abyssal, and did indeed bring her with on the boat.
		-Apparently Libak told Rishi she was an unfortunate victim of the fey, and also our source of
		 information about the manse. Best to keep her near and safe, in case we have further questions.
	-Given the presence of legionnaires and a Wyld Hunt, we all felt it best to get out of town, and
	 opted to take Rishi's suggestion to scout ahead in search of the manse.
	-As such, we made our preparations:
		-We picked up gear and, with a lowest Resources of 2, we all have:
			climbing kit
			crampons (removes penalty for walking on ice)
			fur lined boots, cap, cloak, gloves, waterproofed sleeping bag
			sled
			Snow Bling Goggles
			Snowshoes
			Waterproofed Rope (200FT)
			Waterproofed tarp, tent
			Waterproofing agent (1qt)
		-We also considered hiring a guide, though I had my reservations about letting anyone else
		 near the manse.
			-It proved a moot point, though. This whole affair was born of Orichalcum shards found in
			 the area and, Rishi apparently not being the only one to know of that, the town is
			 packed with treasure hunters. The only guide we found had body guards at the door turning
			 away any that could not offer many talens of jade, a vastly inflated price.
	-We thought it best to avoid being seen leaving the city, and sought to duck out one of the tent
	 city's back alley.
		-Silent Onyx guided us, sneaking ahead as necessary to find a path, and we were able to leave
		 unseen, by either the town guards or the Immaculate soldiers.
	-Immediately outside the bounds of the town, dense forest began.
		-Though it's still Fall, the trees here are already dusted in snow.
			-The air trapped beneath them at the forest floor was still fairly warm beneath the dense
			 canopy, at least.
		-As we setup camp after the first day's travel East, it clicked for Silent Onyx that, full
		 of treasure hunters as these woods are, we might need to worry about thieves, given that we
		 are, after all, bedecked in golden artifacts ourselves.
			-As such, we set a watch while we camped.
			-I took the third watch and, when Libak woke me, he told me of a strange figure he saw
			 running with deer while he kept watch.
				-It's face was surrounded by a halo of branches growing from it, and from it's
				 footsteps grew vines and flowers.
					-By the time I examined the footsteps after waking, the growth had decayed, and
					 rings of mushrooms had sprouted around each footprint.
				-I recognized the creature as a "treefather", guardians of the forest, and generally
				 benign, so long as you're not threatening their forest.
			-During my own watch, I both saw and felt quite the phenomena, a swirling ribbon of golden
			 essence shooting into the sky, reaching a zenith and flashing white, then falling back
			 to earth colored silver.
				-I was even physically pulled towards it as it crashed back to earth.
				-It was off to the East of us, and I take it to be a sign we're indeed on the right
				 track. It may be essence venting from the manse (and is likely less visible to those
				 with lower essence).
	-We broke camp in the morning and continued on towards where we believe the manse lies.
	-As we walked, we came to a clearing, where a monk waited.
		-Red robed and with red-jade gladiuses on his hip, I recognized him as an Immaculate Monk.
			-Silent Onyx noticed and pointed out some archers hiding in the trees nearby too.
		-He said he'd been waiting for us, and said, as an honorable man, we'd be unharmed if we
		 turned the one known as Pip over to him.
		-Libak did his best to talk our way out of this, but was quickly interrupted by the monk,
		 who said we were clearly enscrolled, as he fell into a martial arts stance.
		-With that, battle was joined, with Onyx rushing forward to attack the monk and Libak shortly
		 behind.
		-I, meanwhile, began to follow the monk's example, powering up myself with Invulnerable Skin
		 of Bronze, soon followed by Essence Fangs and Scales as I strode forward slowly.
			-Mumbling, "The dragon is slow to rouse, slow to anger. . ."
		-His power up seems to have resulted in sinuous, flame-like movements.
		-Golden Blade threw a damned tree at the archers, addressing that problem, but was then
		 attacked by previously unseen ninjas, blue robed and throwing chakram at him.
		-I then rushed forward, interposing myself between the monk and my two companions battling him,
		 trying to strike him but only managing a glancing blow against his armor.
			-Now shouting, "But the dragon's wrath is terrible to behold! Face me instead!"
		-The ninjas impaled various points on Blade's body with thrown weapons, nearly paralyzing him
		 (they seem to be poisoned) but he nonetheless managed to scare them off with his aura (a
		 property, I think, of the Dawn Caste).
		-The rest of the circle and I, though, struggled to land blows on the monk.
		-After several nicks, I (with the help of Willpower and Valor) managed to land a solid blow
		 on the monk, from which he staggered back several feet.
		-At that, he turned and fled too, but Silent Onyx took off after him.
		-The rest of us attempted to pursue the fleeing ninjas, but they used some form of kata to
		 disappear.
			-We may still be able to track them, but first need to deal with Blade, who's slowly
			 regaining feeling in his extremities, and Pip, who's having a bit of an existential
			 crisis after giving it her all but being still unable to land an arrow on the monk.
			-By the time we pulled ourselves together, Silent Onyx had returned, carrying the pair of
			 red jade gladiuses and the matching breastplate.
			-We did indeed then began tracking the ninjas, following Libak's lead.
			-Libak was able to lead us along their trail, back to a camouflaged tent suspended between
			 three high trees.
			-Still intent on a peaceful resolution, Libak tried to parlay with them.
			-They (predictably) used the opportunity to ambush us (and Lesley used the opportunity to
			 play with mass combat).
			-We made a mess of them.
			-Afterwards, we went through their stuff, looking for notes or information.
				-We indeed found information, confirming that the Immaculate Monks had been tipped off
				 by a guard, in turn contacted by a sailor, about the anathema named Pip.
					-Cessus Naruka was the fire monk's name.
				-We also found an impossibly balanced knife, perhaps some form of artifact.
		-We then moved on from East from there, deeper into the mountains.
			-With Libak's new found recollections of past-life survivalism, we were able to brave
			 frigid temperatures and avoid a large colony of bears.
			-The path was often precarious, narrow paths along the side of mountains and the like.
				-Apparently there were also some yetis.
			-Eventually, passing through a forest we came to an area that had been strangely scoured
			 of life, what the map called "The Demon Lands". The forest stopped suddenly at it's edge,
			 and even insects were absent within it.


8/2/21: Dining with Demons
	-We began this session on the edge of The Demon Lands.
	-At the edge of this ominous place, I opted for bronze skin and claws. It seems a dangerous
	 place, likely free of _mortal_ witnesses at least.
	-After walking 20 minutes or so in, we came upon a strange structure made of lashed bones,
	 some marker. It was being clawed at by horrific beings, in between fighting among themselves.
	-Onyx and I noticed the wasp-winged creatures resembled demons we'd heard of, Agata.
		-Normally just beautiful wasps, these seemed a horrifying cross between that and a cat.
	-We approached them and Blade attempted to disperse them with charmed threats.
	-He met apparent success, the creatures fleeing immediately.
	-Seemingly in response, though, the mist suddenly thickened, and withdrew. In it's place,
	 ten figures were there, who quickly knealt prostrate before us.
	-They greeted us as Exalted lords (claiming the scent of our essence was. . . unmistakable).
	-With Blade questioning them as to who they are, they claimed to be "The Founders", who helped
	 "Kalbax" construct this place, and who have been here the subsequent 800 years.
		-Their spokesman gave the name U'awa.
	-Asking them about the creatures, they termed them "ice eaters", also trapped here, and a result
	 of lesser races of demons mingling with the animals of the land.
	-Asking them what they wished of us, they wanted to take us to Kordal, their leader and queen.
		-I got the strong impression, both from what they said to us, in Riverspeak, and the bits of
		 Old Realm he used to mutter to himself, that they viewed us as their route out of this place
		 they're trapped in.
	-We assented, and they then asked for a bit of blood from one of us, claiming it "had been so long
	 since they'd had fresh essence here" and that it would allow them to power their charms and speed
	 us along the way.
		-Pip, reckless as ever, was the only one willing, though I thought (through occult lore) that
		 this was neither an unprecedented request and that demons were unlikely to require
		 sympathetic magic.
	-Given the blood, they caused the ice beneath our feet to suddenly move, whisking us along, some
	 25 miles, though this wasteland, to an encampment of demons, which they named Gateway.
	-The shelters were made from every imaginable material to be found in the land, ice, rock, bone,
	 and even the stiched corpses of their fellows.
	-Many, and much varied, demons looked on, many too seeminged like hybrids with various animals.
	-"Take us to your leader."
	-They did indeed lead us into the largest structure, an igloo, on which a massive demonic woman
	 sat atop a pile of skulls, Kordal.
		-The top half was a corpulant witch-woman, atop an enormous, ant-like body.
		-Beyond the skulls, there were scattered about the bones of various meals, picked clean, and
		 a number of the cat-wasp-demons, the ice eaters.
		-U'awa invited us to dine with her and, after a question as to the menu (tubers and the meat
		 of their. . . baser kin), we accepted, dining on what appeared to be salvage (damaged plates,
		 bits of mirrors, pieces of wood, etc.)
		-Though U'awa solicitously asked after our every need, and the other demons picked lightly
		 at the food, Kordal merely stared at each of us in turn.
			-U'awa said something about what she _would_ have wanted, at some point, and, questioned,
			 explained that she was "past the point of being able to speak of her own volition."
		-After the feast, business. U'awa explained that they simply wished to return home, to
		 Malfeas, but that a rune somewhere within the manse bound us to this place. They had searched
		 for it, but to no avail.
			-I asked who had subjected them to this cruel fate, and why.
			-U'awa said that they were brought to this place to construct the manse, but, during the
			 rebellion of the Terrestrials against the Solars, their masters fell, one by one. They
			 begged for release, but were denied, until none still lived to grant it.
		-Golden Blade also broke out some booze, and the reaction was like he'd broken it out at an
		 AA meeting, as the fiends fiended for it.
			-Blade poured each a glass, which they all licked clean with grotesque thirst.
	-We assented to their request, freedom in exchange for their help reaching the manse.
	-Through his charm again, U'awa guided us to the manse at speed, stopping on a scree covered
	 field.
		-I asked U'awa now what he wanted done with the rune. Saying he did not know how the magic
		 worked, he asked that we destroy it in any way that we could.
		-A narrow, winding path, strewn with rubble, led to the hidden fortress, on a high shelf
		 above us.
		-Following the path up, we reached a door with a bronze mask embedded in it, that opened
		 at our approach, the mask splitting as the door opened.
		-Entering, we saw statues of 12 guardian beasts, and a gold masked man, seemingly made of
		 light, appeared, and spoke, in Old Realm, saying, "I Am is online."
		-Blade attempted to speak with it, receieving more Old Realm in response, which I could
		 understand as a request to keep speaking, as it was "calibrating new speech patterns".
		-I spent some time conveying that to my companions, in Riverspeak, only to hear it report
		 the completion of calibration, and begin speaking in Riverspeak, greeting us as masters
		 and welcoming us to The Invisible Fortress.
		-Blade asked it where the bodies of it's former masters lay, but it professed ignorance,
		 claiming that "internal sensors had been damaged".
		-I asked it to tell us more of it's function at the manse.
			-"I am here to assist the Solars with their needs, and the waitstaff in doing the same.
			-Asked for more than that from Libak, it said that it could only say more to the
			 hearthstone bearer.
			-At which, Onyx asked where the hearthchamber lay, to which the flickering figure
			 indicated just inside, naming it "The Grand Salon".
		-We followed his instructions into a great, two story chamber, bedecked in marble and
		 painted with light.
			-Some damage was in evidence to a corner of the ceiling above.
			-Panels depicted murals of The Unconquered Sun.
				-Libak also noticed that they depicted The Unconquered Sun with various features,
				 male and female both, in the various murals. He got the sense they'd depicted The
				 Unconquered Sun with _their_ features, rank heresy and arrogance.
			-The hearthstone, though, was not in evidence.
		-I Am spoke up, mentioning that he detected a storm brewing, one which would make it unsafe
		 to travel outside the manse. . .
		-We asked I Am where the stone was to be found, but he claimed his sensors could not detect
		 it, and that he suspected it was not within the manse.
			-The last person attuned to the hearthstone, he said, was Osandus Pol (the person
			 mentioned in the letters we've heard of), but he did not know where he or the heathstone
			 had gone.
			-Blade asked when last they were seen, but I Am claimed it would be some tie to access
			 records that long, approximately 3 days.
				-Well, he did say there was a storm coming anyways. . .
		-Golden Blade also had I Am list the rooms of the manse for us.
			East -> Parlor
			West -> Dining Room
			North -> Garden 
			South and East -> Parlor 
			South and East and South -> Trophy Room
			South and West -> Loom
			South West and South -> Library, Smithy
		-Blade was hungry, and eager to head to the dining room. Though I was thrilled by the
		 prospect of the library, I agreed that food may be a more urgent concern, if we're about
		 to be snowed in, and we headed there.
			-Within, there was a very creepy figure, a stick figure of bronze rods, draped in ancient
			 tattered robes, wearing a porcelain mask.
			-The mask reminded me of something, the ones from my vision (see top of character bio).
				-Is a soul bound within this one too?
			-No food, though, was in evidence, unless it lay within the locked, stone-doored pantry
			 on one wall, the door of which Blade was unable to force.
		-From there, we walked through the parlor, to the trophy room.
			-Cases of various knickknacks, momentos of past adventures, lined the walls.
			-None looked to be of particular value, though one case had been torn from the wall and
			 smashed.
		-We walked from there into the nearby music room.
			-More intact than most of the manse, a porcelain mask began to speak as we passed the case
			 of instruments, asking if we wished to play one of the instruments within.
			-It could tell us of little else, but when asked about the smashed case, said it contained
			 a demon-skin instruments, destroyed by the demons who had constructed the manse, after
			 the Solars were gone.
			-For more, it suggested we talk with the music master.
				-Asked where they were, it said she was likely in her room, adjoining this one.
				-We indeed went there, and found a once sumptuous bedroom, since stripped of all
				 metal and wood.
				-Lying in a pile of ashes was another porcelain mask.
				-Nudging it with my foot, I tried addressing it, to no effect.
				-Picking it up, however, I found myself again briefly awash in memory. I was quite
				 sure that, fed the tiniest amount of essence, the mask would awake.
				-I did so, and the mask rose into the air, as an elderly woman appeared wearing it.
				-She thanked us for awakening her, and remarked that she did not recognize any of us, 
				 though she _did_ seem to know us as Solars, like the rest of this place.
					-Her name is Liwet Ohazia.
				-I told her we had hoped she could help us in turn, telling us more of the manse and
				 it's functions.
					-She said she could tell us little about the manse, but could speak of those who
					 constructed it.
					-I accepted, and she led us up to an upstairs parlor, bedecked with twelve
					 portraits of the manse's lords.
					-Master Kalbax ("Bax"), of the Twilight caste, constructed this fortress.
					-Ozandus Pal, also of Twilight, was Bax's apprentice, and it was with his
					 ingenuity the manse was completed in time to retreat from the troubles in the
					 South.
					-Crinis Proles, also of Twilight, was the one who painted these portraits, and
					 many of the other works in the manse.
					-The next portrait felt like looking in a mirror She said it was Larquen Quen,
					 of Twilight, and the creator of these masks.
						-Clearly, before me stands a portrait of one of my predecessors, The Last
						 Light's Dragon.
						-He created the spell to preserve the spirits of his greatest servants,
						 forever.
						-The man stands in a circle, surrounded by prostrate elementals, matching
						 my vision.
					-Avika _____, of the Zenith caste, helped Larquen summon the demons that created
					 the fortress. She is depicted playing a flute.
					-Meherrin, of the Zenith caste, was depicted riding bareback through The Wyld, a
					 horn at his lips, flaming spear at his side.
						-Libak seemed to start at this one.
					-Kotor Velos, of the Night caste, depicted as a contortionist, was the first to
					 see the coming trouble, warning Bax.
						-He was described as being in a "Voldo-like" position.
					-Daveg Cholurian, of the Night caste and depicted as a smith, constructed the
					 automatons that server here.
					-Vaznia, of the Night caste, was the one who scouted Malfeas for the demons that
					 constructed the manse.
					-Aeo Orcas, of the Eclipse caste, bound the Solars here in oaths of fealty, that
					 allowed them to exist here in peace, for a time.
					-Itraxian ____, of the Eclipse caste, developed a method that let one weave stone
					 like silk.
					-Surin of Justice, of the Eclipse caste, was spoken ill of by the others, but
					 did what he could to earn his place here.
				-Finishing her tale, she asked if that was all we needed, as she would return to her
				 room, and we assented.
		-We then, searching out the smithy, found instead the loom and spinning room.
			-Strange mechanical equipment was everywhere, largely broken, but it seemed to indeed
			 match the music master's description of a woman who could spin rock like wool, as such
			 was indeed underway, in the service of a half-finished tapestry.
			-A stone desk in one corner held shattered, but painstakingly reassembled clay tablets
			 bore writing.
				-Even though I speak Old Realm, the writing was hard to decipher, but, with some
				 effort, I was able to translate the dialect and determine that they were detailed
				 instructions as to the operation of the machinery, and laments that none would know
				 the operation of it after she was gone, motivating the recording of it.
				-TODO: I should read this to the folks back at my manse, copying it into my own
				 library, via the use of my wooden face.
		-We then found the ransacked smithy, and a pottery and glass blowing studio above.
			-The glass studio had traces of some strange, sharp crystal, as well as glass.
			-From the windows upstairs, we could confirm I Am's weather prediction. Outside was clearly
			 a blizzard.
		-From there, we opted to awaken the figure in the dining room, in the same fashion as the
		 music master.
			-It indeed awakened, and bowed. I asked it its name, but gesturing to its mouth, it
			 indicated it could not speak.
			-I asked if it could help us procure some food. In response, it wandered over to the stone
			 pantry, rapped on it, and opened it revealing jars of mostly dust, some still good honey,
			 and some rock hard bread it banged down onto the table.
			-That was disappointing, but Blade was undeterred, pulling out the cookpot he won in a
			 contest with a god.
				-Tossing the bread and a bit of honey into the pot yielded a delicious stew, and thus
				 it would seem we have access to at least _some_ food.
		-The nearby baths were in rough shape, but boiling water poured from a corroded fixture,
		 apparently from the essence fueled boiler nearby, adjoining both baths and smithy.
		-North of there, we found the library, to my great excitement.
			-The stones shelves were sadly largely empty, with only a few metal sheets remaining in
			 a jumble, seemingly a result of the demons' frantic search for the rune. Fragments of
			 the covers of other tomes lay scatterd on the ground.
			-One of the most intact remaining books, printed on sheets of gold, was missing the back
			 half of its pages, but appeared to be a manual of sorcery by Larquen Quen.
				-This I definitely grabbed, and stuck it in my bag, to be perused after we've explored
				 the rest of the manse.
					-TODO: read that, and give it the wooden face archiving too.
		-West of there lay the conjuring room.
			-It featured three summoning circles, inlaid in the floor with Orichalcum. One for demons,
			 one for elementals, and one unlike anything I'd ever heard, but which yet felt familiar.
			-Hopefully the tome sheds some light on the subject.
		-The next room we found contained the _false_ garden.
			-Decorated with silk flowers and foliage, the worksmanship was supurb, creating a convincing
			 illusion of being outside.
			-The walls were painted with life-like frescos of tranquil garden scenes, making the room
			 feel much bigger than it is.
			-We could feel the two frescos on either side tugging at our essence like artifacts.
				-Libak spent a mote, and was able to _step into the painting_, into a tranquil garden
				 like what's depicted, though one that felt like it extended no further than the size
				 of the false garden.
				-A nice amenity.
		-We took a staircase up from there, leading to a room with a strange labyrinth.
			-It was constructed of random debris from around the mansion, somehow hardened into place
			 and now possessed of stone-like resiliency. From this were formed winding tunnels,
			 through which one would be forced to crawl.
				-Perhaps what the scavenging below was about, instead of or as as well as the
				 construction of Gateway.
				-Come to think of it, is this strange construction the work of the demons? They were
				 brought here for _construction_, after all. . .
			-We broke out some of the rope we'd gotten in our kits for this trip, and Libak ventured
			 into the strange maze.
				-The thing was fiendishly constructed. He doubted that, without Solar-charm-enhanced
				 snese, he would have been able to make it to the heart of it.
				-He later shouted out, as if injured, and, in response to my queries, he claimed to
				 have seen Kotor Velos in here, who stabbed him.
				-Blade and I took up guard positions at either side of the maze's entrance, to deal
				 with anything that fled it, but we doubted two could fight in those tunnels and did
				 not follow Libak in.
				-Later, though, I could hear scuttling, on the otherside of the junk wall from me.
				-Improvising a quick plan, I had Blade swing the bronze me at the wall with all his
				 might.
				-That sufficed to bash through the wall, into the backstage of the maze, with a
				 figure quickly fleeing deeper, into the adjacent room.
				-I ran after it, leaping at it's back to attack as I entered the room.
				-The blow glanced off armor, but off _Libak's_ armor. The figure was suddenly nowhere
				 to be seen.
				-Is it an illusion? Libak claims it stabbed him, with a weapon he showed me.
				-Deeper into the maze's backstage, we came upon a horror scene.
					-More than 30 mummified corpses were in one corner of the room, all but one
					 hanging from spikes on the wall.
						-They seemed to be Northerners of various ages, but all apparently dead at
						 least 50 years.
					-The one on the floor was clearly Kotor Velos, seemingly long dead and mummy-dry
				-Another door from this backstage area led to an antechamber, with further doors
				 going South.
					-We left off there for the session, intending to collect the others and then
					 continue exploring.


8/16/21:
	-Libak and I followed our rope back through the backstage of the maze, to collect the others.
	-We relayed to them the events with the ghost/spirit/whatever, and the grisly tableau we'd
	 found.
		-We knew so-called "hungry ghosts" often rose from the unburied dead, remaining until they
		 fulfilled some purpose, but we were unsure if Libak's sacred flames consuming the corpses
		 had fully addressed the problem or not.
	-We then opted to return along our marked path through the maze, to further explore the second
	 floor of the manse.
	-Blade strode quickly down a hallway, ignoring smaller doors, with us trailing after him.
	 Eventually he came to a door marked by a shredded portrait, and entered.
		-Based on the workroom connected to the shredded bedroom, we surmised it was Kalbax's room.
		-The workroom featured a 16' tall model of the manse, seemingly indestructible, but
		 splattered with what we presumed to be vengeful demon filth.
		-It was also filled with the remains of documents, of which only clay tablets had survived
		 the ages.
			-They, though, depicted blueprints, for both this manse and many other buildings,
			 including even some we recognized as First Age buildings in Nexus!
				-The Nexus buildings interestingly showed extensive underground portions. . .
				-All of that sounds potentially valuable, and certainly worth salvaging, though
				 also somewhat weighty, and in need of careful packing.
	-An adjoining bedroom appeared to belong to Kalbax's student, Pal.
		-In a drawer guarded by a tiny mask, disarmed by Silent Onyx's Charms, we found some letters
		 signed with his mark, to Mithra.
			-letters_to_mithra.pdf
			-We recognized the mark, as he was the author of the letters our captive Abyssal had
			 reproduced for us. Here were more letters to his lover.
	-We found several more bedrooms, though containing little of interest.
	-An office, though, featured a locked, and soon defeated, chest.
		-Inside lay two artifacts, both tied to darkness.
		-One, a band of leather which I recognized as demon skin, showed an indent, as if for the
		 nose. Golden Blade was reluctant to touch it, but I boldly tied it over my eyes.
			-It proved to be a "Shadowlight Caul", inverting darkness and light for the purposes of
			 vision.
			-It seemed of great use to Silent Onyx, who I offered it up to.
		-The other was an amulet, of onyx, orichalum, and jade. Not to be shown up _twice_, Blade
		 placed it around his neck. He was instantly wreathed in concealing shadows, and said it
		 also tugged at his Essence, as if it could be fed Essence for some effect.
			-This too we offered up to Silent Onyx, but he seemed uninterested, confident in his
			 abilities in this area.
			-As such, I volunteered to grab it, saying I wouldn't mind being able to keep up with
			 Onyx in such pursuits, though I said it seemed best to experiment with it's other
			 functions in safer circumstances.
	-A much smaller bedroom contained a mask on the remains of a bed.
		-Feeding it 5 motes of essence, I awoke what turned out to be the head servant.
		-He was very helpful, mentioning:
			-That tombs for each of the solars once residing here had been constructed, in advance
			 of their need, in the cellar. Only Kelbax had been laid to rest when last the valet
			 was awake.
				-Ask by Blade what he may have been buried with, the valet was unsure, but speculated
				 that his white robe and rune stone (!) may still lie with him.
			-That defenses were controlled from the parlor with it's portraits of the solars, though
			 he did not know how they worked.
			-That he was in charge of the staff, and was the first bestowed with this new form, as
			 their lifespans reached their ends.
				-I asked him how he felt about that and he said, strangely, "I do not know."
				-"You do not recall?" I asked.
				 "I do not. . . feel, the way I once did, in this form. . ."
				-Not the most pleasant existance, sounds like. . .
	-From there, we decided to return to the parlor and investigate the defenses.
		-In the South of the room, glass orbs were mounted on four daises, with mirrors behind them.
		-Blade approached one, and, when he got close, the mirror changed, and revealed a scene
		 outside the fortress, snow in motion, falling.
		-I was unsure of the function of the devices, but Onyx termed them "metasorcerous
		 resonators", having apparently encountered (read: stolen) a paper related subject. Sorcery
		 and other Charms can be used _through_ such things. Often, they're paired with artifacts
		 or magitech that can summon elementals, such that a melee charm used through the orb would
		 be performed by the elemental.
	-After that, most were eager to investigate the tombs in the cellar, but I pushed instead to
	 first sweep the attic, suspecting the situation may. . . evolve rapidly once we held the rune.
	-The attic featured many large rooms, many featuring large holes in their roofs, through which
	 snow fell onto tables full of dead plants.
	-Down a hallway, though, we could see a trail of brown, long dried blood along the still-clear
	 floor.
		-Inside was a grisly tableau, blood scattered everywhere and a corpse, surrounded by
		 surgical instruments, on a table. A distance away from the table, a severed arm, _not_
		 belonging to the corpse, lay on the floor.
			-Libak looked the scene over thoroughly, eventually concluding that the corpse had been
			 experimented on, while alive, but had fought back, severing someone's arm, only to fall,
			 wounded or dead, a short distance away and be dragged back to the table.
				-Looking close, we thought it might be Crinis Proles, one of the exalts in the
				 portraits above (in fact, likely the one who painted them).
			-Meanwhile, Pip and I examined the arm, clad in a bracer.
				-The bracer was marked with writing in Old Realm, writing I could see were prayers
				 to Brigid, Mother of Sorcery.
				-They also seemed to have a socket for a hearthstone.
				-Pip put them on, and felt nothing, though pins did emerge from the heartstone
				 socket, and then retract.
				-I (still being cagey about my own manse) offered to examine it further, and see
				 what I could learn, so Pip gave it over to my care.
					-Looking them over quickly, they seemed somehow similar to the metasorcerous
					 resonators. Perhaps again something sorcery can be used _through_?
	-The rest of the attic was empty, so we headed to the basement.
		-At the base of the stairs we followed down, great glass blades had emerged from the last
		 two stairs, some dusty time ago.
			-Looks like the demons may have had a poor time here.
		-Exploring the basement, we came upon a mask hanging on the wall, clearly sylized as a cook
		 (chef's hat, Boyardee mustache, etc.).
			-Feeding it five motes of essence, the figure formed indeed offered us food.
			-Though, asked about the stores, he confessed they were bare, but inisted that, given
			 time, he could make *something*.
				-Asking him what that would be seemed to yield only a loop, so we assented, and
				 asked where we should wait, and he suggested the arena, saying our predecessors
				 often took meals there in between training.
		-The arena was a large open room, likely beneath the grand salon and similar in size save
		 height. It's walls were lined with mundane-but-sericeable examples of seemingly every
		 melee weapon known to creation.
			-Three bronze centurions stood in alcoves around the room, each surrounded by a set of
			 weaponry. Presumably the automaton opponents offered by the training room.
		-Mere moments later, a parade of masked servants delivered dish after dish to the room,
		 piled high with foods of all sorts.
			-It looked fantastic, and felt like real food, but smelled and tasted like little to
			 nothing. It provided the feeling of fullness, but, from the letters, you suspect it
			 offerred no nourishment.
			-We spent an hour dining nonetheless, then continued through the basement.
	-The next door we checked led to a. . . servant's dormitory of a kind.
		-It's walls were coverred in racks of masks, hundreds of them, perhaps a thousand.
		-Some suggested clear roles, maid masks, cook masks, etc., but the vast majority were marked
		 with an Old Realm symbol, which Blade called me over to tranlsate.
			-It was the mark of Rabszolga, god of slaves. . .
			-This not unsuprisingly irked Golden Blade, who grabbed one, and fed essence into it.
			-A small, emaciated man appeared, to fill out the mask, and Blade asked him who he was,
			 to which he received no response.
			-Asked if he understood, the figure nodded, but did not seem able to speak.
			-Golden Blade then asked if he wished to be free of this existence, getting another nod
			 in response. Blade then immediately smashed the mask.
			-He then began babbling about how best to smash many masks.
				-"All of the masks?" I asked him.
				 "The slaves."
				-Between Libak and myself, we convinced him it was perhaps not the time, given the
				 danger we were still in, and that it could be hazerdous, messing with things only
				 half understood here. He agreed to return to the matter later.
	-Another set of doors proved to be the cooks kitchen and scullery, now dormant, and thoroughly
	 ransacked, leaving some question as to the origin of the false food.
	-On the other side of the hallway, we found our first tomb, in what seemed to be a former
	 storeroom.
		-Writing in Old Realm marked it as the tomb of Larquen Quen (!).
			-I did a lot of describing of Garn's suspicious reactions to this, though never admitted
			 to my connection to Quen. _Especially_ after some comments about him being the "monster"
			 who created these masks.
			-Though Garn was reluctant, the others plowed ahead with opening the tomb.
				-The corpse inside was missing an arm (!).
					-Yet more grisly crimes on his (my?!?) part.
				-The inside of the tomb, meanwhile, was covered in scratches, and some of them formed
				 words: "I will return" (!!!)
				-After Pip translated that, the rest of the circle hurridly closed the tomb again with
				 it's slab.
	-Itraxian the Weaver
		-This tomb was already open, and there were ropes suspended from pulleys in the ceiling,
		 seemingly used to lift the slab on top of it, such that we could simply peer in.
		-It contained _three_ bodies. One nothing but bones, one cut in half, one mummified and pinned
		 to the wall by a scythe blade, likely part of a sprung trap.
			-The bones had a orichalum ring, set with a single jewel.
			-The trap-pinned mummy, on the other hand, bore the Mon of House Peleps, one of the
			 twelve great houses of the Dragonborn. Perhaps we were not the first to find the
			 manse in the last millenia. . .
	-The ring was of interest, but we thought it best to perhaps have Libak ritually incinerate the
	 corpses before we further disturbed grave goods.
		-In discussing the matter, I asked if we shouldn't retrieve Larquen's arm before doing so.
		-Seeing the opportunity for a good deed, Pip characteristically ran off, shouting that she'd
		 go fetch it.
	-Perhaps 15-20 minutes later, Silent Onyx, the most perceptive of us, claimed to hear a knocking,
	 as if at a metal door, coming from above.
		-We followed him up to the first floor, where someone was indeed banging on the door, now
		 faintly.
		-Looking from one to another, Blade went to go open the door, revealing a half-frozen Pip,
		 collapsed at the threshold of the gate, wounded.
		-None of us are overly competant when it comes to medicine, but I seemed to guess most.
			-I worried that too quick a temperature change may harm her, but remembered that bath's
			 offered a _cool_ water pool as well, and we carried her to it, immersing her within.
			-Gradually, she came to, and relayed a tale of encountering and unknown man, who fled
			 for the roof, climbing a rope through one of the holes in the attic's ceiling.
			-She had followed, but lost her footing on the snowy roof and fell, narrowly missing
			 spikes of ice below. She crawled from there to the gate, hoping to find her way back
			 inside.
	-After Pip soaked for 20 minutes, she was feeling up to _walking_ at least, and we returned to
	 the grand salon, to question I Am.
		-Libak asked if there was some form of surveillance system in the manse, to which I Am
		 replied that "a matrix of custodial dedication" existed.
			-At that, I Am flickered, and apparently rebooted, introducing himself again.
		-Libak then asked if I Am had access to the system, to which it admitted partial access, so
		 Libak asked if it had seen whatever figure had been assailing us.
			-"There are none living or operating in the manse aside from you six and myself."
		-Further questions about the limits of the system earned the response that, "Discussions of
		 weaknesses of the manse are limited to the hearthstone bearer."
			-Who, Libak asked, was last attuned to the heathstone.
			 "Ozandus Pal."
			 "When was the connection broken?"
			 "Unknown. Speculation: 700 years ago."
			-I Am also seemed to doubt the possibility of any backdoor access to the system.
				-Asked if any could have created such a thing, I Am said only those resident here
				 could have. Beyond Kelbax, only Ozandus Pal, Cirinus Proles, Larquen Quen, and
				 Maheren would have had the skill.
				-After that, I Am again flickered and rebooted.
	-After I Am's reboot, we heard an immense thump from the Southeast, shaking the building.
		-We could hear many voices, some shouting words, other more. . . bestial.
		-Hurrying up to the parlor, we used one of the mirrors behind the daises, and saw that the 
		 demon horde had come, Kordal among them and U'awa directing them from a dias borne by
		 ape-like demons. They were battering the walls of the manse, even using trebuchets of
		 their typical salvage-built construction.
			-Among them were also wasp-winged bird hybrids (!).
				-"Beware the birds."
		-Libak was intent on figuring out what triggered this assault, and I suggested that perhaps
		 a charm of the voice could be used through one of the orbs, to communicate with them.
			-Using a Performance excellency, Libak went (unexpectedly) fully iconic, and a great
			 golden image of Libak suddenly stood before the manse, asking, "Why have you come to 
			 interrupt our investigation?"
			-Through the mirror, we could see U'awa shouting and gesturing, but heard no words. The
			 trebuchet-flung rocks that followed immediately, suggested the words may not have been
			 for our ears anyways.
			-Blade tried Judge's Ear Technique through the orb, generating a similar golden figure
			 of himself, but could hear only roaring and warcries.
			-Resorting to a different tactic, he instead attempte Mob Dispersing Rebuke through an
			 orb, causing many of the more. . . mixed breeds to flee, though The Founders, the
			 more traditional looking demons, stood fast.
			-He then _rallied_ the fleeing crossbreeds, with Fury Inciting Presence.
				-"We are not your enemies, the ones who made you and prey on you are! You have nothing
				 to lose but your chains!"
				-Some portion of them indeed attacked their kin, causing chaos, but still the
				 trebuchets struck the building.
		-I then tried my (clawed) hand at one of the orbs, falling into a martial arts form, and
		 stepping towards the orb. I reached out to it and, touching it, imagined reaching _through_
		 it, striking out at one of the trebuchets in the "mirror", using my Armor-Penetrating Fangs
		 Strike.
			-A golden avatar of myself indeed appeared, striking the trebuchet with a fist wreathed
			 in in twining golden dragons, smashing both the trebuchet and the crew surrounding it
			 with an immense fist.
		-Libak then suddenly shouted, saying he knew where the tomb was, running off down the hall
		 toward Bax's chambers.
			-"It's under the model!"
			-Blade and I both ran after him, I shouting cautions: "By all the gods, whatever you do,
			 I _don't_ think we should be unleashing these demons on Creation!"
			-At the model, he stopped to examine it, and I, warning Libak one more time that we
			 probably should not give the demons what they want, then shouted to Blade: "Come! Let
			 us finish those trebuchets!"
		-Back at the orbs, Blade took his own swing(s) at the trebuchets, smashing the remaining
		 three trebuchets.
		-By that time, Libak had returned, bearing a golden book and _a rune inscribed stone tablet!_
			-He rushed over, asking if for someone who could read Old Realm, and I stepped forward
			 to take the tablet and book.
			-The book's cover read, "Manse Construction, by Kalbax".
			-The tablet's runes, meanwhile, read "Binding", "Command", and "Obedience".
				-I fed it essence until it drank no more, 20 essence in total, and then seemed to
				 radiate an aura of authority
					-Are those motes _committed_? If merely spent, I how long does the effect
					 last? The circle seemed to notice the aura of authority.
					-Talked with Lesley.
						-To turn it on, you go iconic and it consumes all of one of your essence
						 pools, typically personal.
						-When attuned, for 1 mote, and you talk to a demon of Kordal's brood, it
						 counts as unnatural mental influence and they must spend your essence in
						 willpower to ignore your order.
						-While holding it, you also get the benefits of Enemy Castigating Solar Judgement 
							-You deal aggravated damage towards the brood, and also have some social
							 combat benefits.
			-I suspected we now had in hand what we needed to address the demons.
			-I instructed the circle to follow me downstairs, to the gate of the manse, and then
			 walked down the stairs.
			-Only at the gate did I turn around, to see that all of the circle had indeed followed,
			 and told them to on their guard.
			-With that, I drew a breath, and then pushed open the doors of the manse.
			-At the sight of me, the demons fell to their knees (or whatever they might have to
			 bend) in an expanding wave.
			-"What is this treachery that brings howling you to the gates of the manse, in violation
			 of our deal?"
			-It was U'awa who replied, shouting that they didn't trust us to honor the deal, and
			 that they had come to destroy the rune.
			-"It is you who violated the deal! We stand absolved of the bargain!"
				-Conveniently what Garn wanted.
			-"Turn your backs to the manse, and stand guard! Raise the hue and cry if any save our
			 circle and your host are seen!"
			-At that, Kordal finally found her voice, releaseing a terrible, insectoid screech, but
			 even her great bulk seemed unable to resist and, though she struggled, she turned.
			-At that, I slammed the doors and, turning, leaned back against them and let out a,
			 "Whew!"
				-When I did, just momementarily, I saw the old Solars who first resided here, worn
				 and out of breath themselves, presumably during their own retreat into the manse,
				 before it faded back to my own circle.
	-With the demons addressed for the moment, we went to check out this preserved room Libak spoke
	 of.
		-It lay through a door behind the now-shifted model, and seemed to be Bax's true bedchamber.
		-It also looked to be unsacked, with many books and scrolls still lining the walls.
		-A search of them revealed most or all to be manse blueprints, some of which we recognized.
			-They described manses located in Nexus, Lookshy, being used as government buildings in
			 various parts of The Riverlands, and _The Imperial War Manse, The Sword of Creation,
			 the fucking Imperial Manse with which The Empress seized The Realm!_
				-The ones for that last are partial, from an _upgrade_, not it's constuction, but
				 include what are supposedly detailed maps of it's interior!
				-Well holy fuck. Who wants to rule Creation?
			-The rooms windows were bricked up, and perhaps the model can even be shifted back,
			 concealing it for as many more centuries as we might require, making it perhaps the
			 manse's most defensible room. We can barricade it and rest inside.
				-Garn did some reading of that golden book during that rest.
					-It heavily discusses manse construction.
					-It also includes two spells, a Celestial one and a Solar one:
						-The Celestial spell is Raise the Puissant Sanctum (White Treatise pg. 79).
						-The Solar spell works in the same way, but works instaneously, and costs
						 20 more motes.
					-In addition, it adds +5 auto successes to design rolls when constructing manses
					 and allows for construction of manses with UNLIMITED manse creation points.
				-You also had some time, during your guard shift, to play with new artifacts.
					-Socketing your manse's hearthstone into the bracer with the prayer to Brigid 
					 and attuning to it, you became aware of it's nature and powers.
						-It is a Metasorcerous Phylactery. See Roll20.
					-The amulet, then, proved to hold two more powers when fed essence.
						-It is an Amulet of Shadow (rank 5 version, with all the powers). See Roll20.
						-It's use fits your anima, as you alternate between hidden and shining.
						-Holy shit; it allows you to interact with the incorpreal in Shadow Form!


8/30/21:
	-In the run up to the session, Libak asked me what I knew of Meherrin, and I shared what I'd
	 read in this place.
		-He admitted to holding some of Meherrin's memories, and when I asked, said he did indeed
		 suspect Meherrin was his past incarnation.
	-We probably need to secure some food, as I, at least, could spend a century digesting this place.
		-Eating demons is probably an option, but poses. . . ethical questions.
		-The conjured food won't help us long term as, even with the cook pot, it offers no real
		 sustenance.
		-The masked servant in the dining room _was_ able to get a rock-hard chunk of black bread
		 from the otherwise unopenable cabinet there, which the cookpot _could_ render edible.
		-Stealthy supply runs may also be an option, once the blizzard dies down.
	-We also discussed the subject of the tombs, and opted to seek them out again first.
		-Libak now has the motes to put the occupents (more thoroughly) to rest.
		-Pip was very intent on this, and, in so doing, kept speaking of "my" ring, in Itraxian's
		 tomb.
			-I questioned her and she did indeed believe Itraxian to have been here own past
			 incarnation.
		-We headed first back to Itraxian's again, to retrieve the ring.
			-OOC, something I wasn't clearly aware of last time, the tomb is 30 ft. deep, posing
			 something of a challenge.
			-Rishi sent us off well equiped with rope, though, and, tying some to the rigging that
			 had been used to lift the slab, Libak climbed down (he being the Zenith who could
			 incinerate the corpses with sacred fire).
			-Libak did his caste's thing, and retrieved the ring, climbing back up.
				-He did report some strange gas or the like, bending his perceptions at the bottom,
				 perhaps another trap.
			-The ring possessed strange properties, including an arm that always pointed to our
			 Southwest (from the room we're in, anyways).
			-Libak handed it to Pip, who recalled that it was her _personal_ Resplendent Personal
			 Assitant (see Roll20, but this one requires no mote committed).
			-Pip then froze for a moment, only to shout "Cease!" at me, when she came to.
			-Questioning her, she said she witnessed my past incarnation's work on the table above,
			 at which I did have to admit I was Quen come again.
		-We then went through the door from Itraxian's tomb that we'd not yet explored, to find yet
		 another tomb.
			-This one belonged to Vaznia, of the Night Caste.
			-Silent Onyx spent a long time staring at the inscriptions on the walls. . .
			-Turning a way from them, though, he quickly set to work on the tomb.
				-Tomb raiding seemed to be a matter he was quite experienced with.
				-He carefully disabled several traps, removing needles, fragile jars of who knows
				 what, and under-tension razor wire.
				-It too was 30' deep, the bottom smothered in shadows.
				-He had our newly found Caul, though, and, blindfolding himself, could see the
				 bottom.
				-Within, a skeleton lay in a pile a junk, the bottom 6' or so covered in scratches.
					-The skeleton's finger bones seemed correspondingly worn down. . .
			-Libak again volunteered to descend into the tomb, to incinerate the corpse, and did so
			 without incident.
			-Searching through the junk down there, Libak found a strange mirror, wrapped in cloth.
				-The mirror had something smeared over it, blacking it out entirely, and the cloth
				 had writing in Old Realm, done in the same brown material as blocked the mirror.
				-Retuning to the top, he showed it to me and, ugh, I reported that it said, "It's
				 watching me, through the mirror."
				-Onyx having admitted a connection to Vaznia, I asked him to take a look, but no
				 recollection sprung to mind.
		-From there, we continued to sweep the as of yet unexplored portions of the basement.
			-We first came to a pantry, and, with a stroke of luck, 16 jars remained intact.
			-Opening one of them, I found a number of biscuits, though the one I touched quickly
			 crumbled.
			-Pouring a jar into the cookpot gave us at least _some_ sustenance for the morning,
			 though.
				-Seems like each jar could sustain the lot of us for a day.
		-Off the pantry, a metal door led to a room that was extremely cold, it's walls comprised
		 of blocks of blue ice.
			-Inside, a large, headless ape corpse was chained, though it's size and the huge bone
			 spike jutting from it's shoulders suggest it was no _normal_ ape.
		-Off the kitchen, we found another tomb, in what seemed to have once been a wine cellar.
			-It was the tomb of Kotor Velos, as indicated by numerous images of him lining the walls.
			-We set Onyx to work on the tomb, and he soon had it open, with no traps in evidence
			 this time.
			-The interior of the tomb, this time, was collapsed, the walls caved in and the shaft
			 filled with debris.
			-Not willing to leave a stone unturned if treasures may lie beneath, Onyx climbed down
			 and began digging through the rubble.
			-Sure enough, nearly four feet into the rubble, he found a black jade egg.
			-Bringing it back up, he showed it to me, and I named a "Cache Egg", somehow able to
			 take objects elsewhere, though I was unsure of it's operation.
			-Libak knew it's operation and, instructing Onyx in it's operation, Onyx spent a mote
			 and touched it, revealing a pair of silver and white jade axes, each with _three_
			 hearthstone sockets.
				-It's appearence suggested, in fact, a _level 4_ cache egg, able to hold up to 10
				 cubic yards. It also has the ability to be banished Elsewhere, concealing the egg.
				-See Roll20 for full details.
				-This vastly improves our ability to make stealthy supply runs from here.
		-Continuing to the East side of the basement, we found a room marked as the tomb of Kelbax.
			-We already found his body above, though.
			-I warned against a likely trap, and Onyx set to work.
			-The tomb was indeed trapped and vacant, but also had seemingly fresher stonework at the
			 bottom, forming the clear shape of a door in the wall.
			-Onyx descended into the tomb, dodging a second trap in the process.
			-Reaching the bottom, though, we heard a loud click and, below us, could see Onyx
			 profusely sweating blood from his every pore.
			-He slowly dragged himself back up the rope, asking if any of us were doctors, to which
			 we all kind of shrugged.
				-Golden Blade unhelpfully offered him a bottle of whiskey.
			-Libak bravely volunteered, without a second's hesitation, to take a look down there
			 next.
				-Well. . . on second thought, he's still troubled by a stab wound. Perhaps it would
				 be best to rest a bit before again trying our luck again here.
	-We grabbed a couple of jars of biscuits, and headed back up to Kelbax's secret room to rest.
		-Onyx and I both made a concerted effort to investigate the mechanism for closing and hiding
		 the rooms door again. I had no real idea, but Onyx noticed an odd object that, moved on the
		 shelf, revealed a control panel that allowed him to seal and hide the room again.
		-While the others rested, Blade and I headed over to the dining room, to investigate the
		 bread we'd been able to get there previousl.
			-Activating the servant there and experimenting, it was willing to bring each of us that
			 asked a loaf of bread three times a day.
			-Over the next several days, we were able to retrieve some 6 days worth of loaves for
			 us, though they eventually ran out.
		-We also spent a lot of time debating options for leaving this place, with the blizzard
		 being our biggest barrier.
			-As such, we opted to ask I Am about the weather, and maybe even weather control, but
			 with no real luck.
	-In three days, Libak, at least, would be healed, and also able to learn a charm that would aid
	 him in investigating the tomb, so we sealed ourselves in Bax's room.
		-I set about dictating what I could, via my Wooden Face.
			-I did Quen's manual of sorcery and the tablet with instructions for the rock weaving
			 process, at least.
		-On the second day, we heard the sounds of battle coming from outside the manse.
		-Rushing to the defense stations, we could see a great battle taking place outside, between
		 the demons and The Wyld Hunt.
			-The battle was short and bloody, ultimately won by the demons, who played with and
			 gradually ate the survivors.
			-The demons took heavy losses themselves, though.
			-As it ended, we heard the doors beneath us open, and then slam shut.
		-Heading down to the vestibule, we found a trail of blood leading from the door, off through
		 the dining room.
			-Following it, we could hear a woman sobbing in the library.
			-Entering it, we could see her, critcally wounded by grevious claw marks, leaning against
			 a shelf.
				-"Kill me if you want, anathema!"
				-As we discussed her fate, she mentioned something about the storm extending all the
				 way to Wangler's Knob, which doesn't sound good for us.
				-It finally dawned on us, much to Onyx's frustration, that perhaps some of the
				 servants knew something of medicine.
					-I rushed off with Pip to the head servant's room, asking him if any of the
					 servants were knowledgeable about medicine.
					-He knodded, and led us down to the room full of masks, pulling down three of
					 them. I thanked him and rushed back to the library.
					-Asking if anyone had motes to spare, Libak volunteered to feed 5 motes into
					 each of the masks.
					-That yielded the forms of 3 women, with white smocks and leather gloves, who
					 immediately set to work on the woman, pulling tools from ghostly bags and
					 performing a field surgery sans anethesia.
					-The removed the woman's. . . strange cloak, formed of two bolts of black cloth
					 and bits of black metal we recognized as soulsteel, a thing we associated with
					 _deathknights_.
					-She also had a disk of orichalum, two boxes that crackled strangely when
					 touched, and an orichalum chakra.
						-Some rations as well, helpfully.
					-Eventually, she seemed stable, and barely conscious.
						-The servants then set to work on Onyx.
				-She seemed shocked we'd let her live.
					-She said that her life was a debt she could not easily repay, but did say she
					 wished to offer _something_.
					-As such, she told us of the artifacts she carried (Roll20 has them):
						-The wings had a fivefold harmonic adapter attached, allowing her, and perhaps
						 us, to use it as a deathknight would. They allowed the wearer to fly, and
						 could also be used as daiklaives.
							-The adapter itself is backed with soulsteel, limiting it's use to
							 soulsteel artifacts.
							-See Wings of the Raptor in Roll20.
						-The buzzing boxes were Lightning boxes.
						-The chakram then, was a "Sun's Fist Chakram", and was part of how they
						 disrupted the storm.
				-We stepped out of the room, to discuss her fate, leaving Pip to guard her.
					-I was intent on what we could learn from her, Libak on mercy, and both Blade
					 and Onyx on mercy.
				-We suddenly heard a shout from Pip, yelling, "What the fuck was that?"
					-Rushing into library, we saw Pip standing over the woman with her Rak staff,
					 while she shouted, "I did not cast it!"
					-Libak and Blade had already used their Judge's Ear Technique, and she did not
					 seem to be lying.
					-She claimed her cousin had cast a spell, the Infallible Messenger, attempting
					 to find her, though it allowed no response.
						-Again, no lies.
					-Blade began to generally behave like a psycho, demanding that she agree to kill
					 her family for some reason, a thing she said she did not _wish_ to do, insisting
					 that he must kill her as a result.
					-He drew his blade, while I moved to parry it and Libak and Pip sought to talk
					 him down.
					-They did seem to meet with some success, at least buying some time to craft an
					 oath, without me having to catch blade with claw.
	-We left off there, with a week of downtime, time for Pip and Libak to create their oath, Silent
	 Onyx to heal, and perhaps some amount of advancement.


TODO:
	-Spend XP?
		-That week of downtime is enough for a spell.
			-The repair spell?
				-Committing to it! XP spent, and Lesley will be giving you the rest of the book.
		-Or Occult charms? The charms and abilities both could be instant.
			-Spirit-Detecting Glance is great now that you have an artifact that would let you
			 attack them without another charm. It's a mere 8 XP.
			-Still possible with the spell.
			-13 more would then even get you Occult 4 and Ghost-Eating Technique. . .
		-Only need to save 24 XP to go up in Essence when next you have 3 months.
			-Not direly urgent, though.
			-Maybe get Spirit-Detecting Glance, counting on the fact that you'll get at _least_ 3
			 more XP before your next batch of downtime?
				-Lets confirm the details of that Amulet of Shadow Walking and then do it.
				-Ah, it lets you see them anyways!
	-Suspend spells?
		-The trigger function of the Metasorcerous Phylactery allows this.
		-Do the hearthstone dots regenerate _even if the spell has not yet triggered_? If so, this
		 is _crazy good for you.
			-Lesley ruled that they do indeed! Asked about it here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/882015425800585307
			-Also confirmed spell cost motes regenerate: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/882375725099937824

		.   Well, then, for the rest of the circle, Garn spends most of the week we're barricading ourselves in Bax's room sitting on the floor, legs crossed and eyes closed, apparently meditating.
		.   At the beginning of the week, though, he pulls up his long sleeves, undoes the strips of white cloth wrapping something on his forearms, revealing them to be a pair of shining Orichalcum bracers. Slowly, he removes them both, and, from one of them, removes a lustrous orange gem stone (a hearthstone, to those who'd recognize it). He takes it, and inserts it into socket on another bracer, the ornate one found on the severed arm in the attic above, and places that artifact on his right arm.
		.   He then immediately sets about casting three spells, to no apparent effect, only to then reverse the process with the bracers, stashing the new one back in his bag, and then going back to maybe-meditating on the floor.
		.   Towards the end of the week, he again springs into strange action, this time pulling a damaged book from his backpack. It's one from the library in the manse, missing the back half of it's golden pages. He begins a casting ritual over it, though, and, a minute later, it's been restored to seemingly pristine condition, all pages intact. He then sits right back down on the floor and begins reading it, starting from the middle.
		(He doesn't offer any explanations of what he's doing, though you're more than welcome to question him!)


TODO:
	-Figure out a source of more food.
		-Our limited stores are running low.
		-Libak seems like he's getting charms to address that.
		-Ritual of Elemental Empowerment could potentially help a little bit too, giving +3 dice to
		 Resistance rolls vs. cold.
	-Figure out what's going on with that ghost/spirit/whatever that's fucking with us in the manse.
	-Continue looking through the tombs.
	-Downtime mask servant interactions:
		-Ask them a lot about their subjective experience.
			-"Do you. . . miss what you now lack?"
			-You're a bit unsure what you think if this was a great blessing sort-of-you gave them, or
			 a terrible atrocity you/he committed. You're terribly tempted by this wonder, and want to
			 believe it's a _gift_, one the your monks/family would be _glad_ to have. You're just also
			 a bit horrified by the idea of _being_ such a being.
			-Did a little bit of this in session. Search "I asked him how he felt about that" above.
		-Ask them about Larquen Quen?
			-_Probably_ leaving out your connection to him, at least at first. If pressed as to the
			 reason for your curiosity, you can volunteer an interest in sorcery, and his writings
			 that you found.
	-Figure out what to do with the artifact dagger, and those red jade blades and breastplate.
		-The dagger: dagger, +1 acc, +2 dam, 3m attune, +1 acc every additional mote spent (max 5)
		-I had been thinking the jade stuff may also be artifacts, but that seemed less likely,
		 after the way Lesley revealed dagger stats more or less immediately upon examination.
			-Ah, sounds like they are artifacts indeed.
		-The "Slayer Katars" from Kotor Velos too.
			-See Roll20 for stats.
		-And whatever Libak was stabbed with, in the maze.
			-Stats from Lesley: "pointy: speed 5, acc +1, dam +2Agg, def +0, Rate 3"
	-Read some stuff via your Wooden Face.
		-Search TODO above. At least two things exist.
		-The letters_to_mithra.pdf as well.
		-Oh! _Can_ you do this? Look at the spell description, if you can switch your perception
		 back and forth or not.
			-Yep!
		-Done:
			-First half of Larquen's manual of sorcery.
			-The tablet describing the operation of the rock weaving machine.
	-Bring back Kalbax's architectural drawings, and go through them.
		-Both the details of manse construction and blueprints for ancient buildings around Creation,
		 Nexus included, seem useful.
		-Oh! In his secret bed chamber, that gets turned up to 11!  Search "manse blueprints" above.

			"you dont know much about larquen quen, except what you have discovered at the previous manse. he knew when he died he would reincarnate, he also knew he would need time to train and a mentor to train him. he built a manse and had several people there to assist him with the training. he was considered a powerful and respected sorceror who knew how to use the spirits of creation to do his bidding.
			the only thing you know from your manse is that he was developing a new kind of magic, something he discovered with his time amongst a group called "the black Nadir Concordant." whatever the magic was it was considered dangerous to even the first age solars and was made illegal
			and, with what you have found from the pages of that book, maybe the masks have something to do with that"
		-Totally plays into what I'm interested in exploring with Garn, as I discuss here, in
		 response to the above: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876865918146342963
	-That runestone TODO, above.
	-Investigate the "manual of sorcery by Larquen Quen".
		-Search the quote for it in the notes.
		-It was described as missing the back half of it's pages.
		-Read what you can, and read it _to_ your monks for archiving.
			-The discussion about what I already knew about Larquen revealed some tidbits of what's
			 in there: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876862341491347476
				-The especially-relevant-to-the-book bit:
					"the only thing you know from your manse is that he was developing a new kind of magic, something he discovered with his time amongst a group called "the black Nadir Concordant." whatever the magic was it was considered dangerous to even the first age solars and was made illegal
					and, with what you have found from the pages of that book, maybe the masks have something to do with that"
			-Lesley posted the bit that's readable in Roll20. READ IT!
				-It's entitled "Concerning Spirits".
				-He. . . comes off as a colossal dick, even in his own writings.
					-A slaver and worse, sorcerously contorting the bodies of his victims, and
					 eventually manipulating their very souls.
				-The mask servants are now a kind of _god_, at the cost of their freewill, and thus
				 allowing the development of unique magical powers, as we likely saw with the cook's
				 conjured food.
					-A _necessary_ cost? Or Something Larquen considered a _feature_?
				-He also journeyed to the Underworld, a taboo, invited along by Meherrin to loot
				 the tombs of the slain primordials for the secrets of Sorcery lost with them.
					-It's where they come to the tombs that it's cut short by the torn out pages. . .
		-Then Incantation of Effective Restoration can probably restore it!
			-"The sorcerer also needs more than half of the decayed item's remains to restore it."
				-Pg. 50 of Books of Sorcery vol. 2
			-Sounds like it passes muster. Roughly half the pages are missing, but I think the
			 covers were mostly intact.
				-Yep, Lesley confirmed it should work.
			-Yep, did it, and the second half is now in Roll20.
