4/12/21:
	-Exalted for roughly a month now, we're based out of Nexus.
		-Nexus is the 2nd largest city in the world, with 2/3rds of a million residents.
			-It's a strange city.
			-It's most serious laws are enforced by the Emissary, a creature that has served The
			 Council of Nexus since the founding of the city. The penalty is always an inventively
			 gruesome death.
				-That "dogma" says (eh, see pg. 63 of Core rules for exact text):
					No taxes shall be raised except by the council.
					No one shall interfere with trade.
					No one will bring an army into Nexus.
						-Mercenary companies carefully circumvent this, only going about in small groups.
					None shall commit wanton violence.
						-Obstruction of trade is a heavy component of what makes it "wanton".
						-Boxing and serial killers have both managed to evade that qualifier.
					None shall falsely claim the the council's name or sanction.
					None shall harbor a a fugitive from the council.
			-There are also the far more minor "civilities". They can and do change.
				-Longstanding ones include:
					You can't drink alone after nightfall.
					The solar known as Harmonious Jade is not allowed within the walls of Nexus.
	-We're each either in the service of Silver-Tongued Rishi or the mercenary captain Hawk who
	 is under contract to Rishi.
		-Silver-Tongued Rishi is a Scavenger Lord, one who seeks out wonders from The First Age.
			-He makes his home near the Wyld Zone of the Firewander district.
		-Hawk is well-famed and thought to be blessed by the gods, having never lost a battle.
			-He leads Hawk's Chargers, who are based out of a compound in the NW of the Cinnabar
			 district.
		-I sought out Silver-Tongued Rishi for his knowledge of The First Age and it's works, with
		 designs on learning the trade and taking it up myself.
			-I've kept the fact that I'm a Solar Exalted from him thus far (I think).
	-We remember that we were a circle in our past lives, and can feel that the others are somehow
	 special when in their presence.

	Questions for @everyone to consider;

	How did you exalt?
	------------------
		(I'd originally had in mind having Exalted quite a bit longer than a month ago, in part owing to the training time involved in sorcery, but having spent all of that time cloistered and studying until, yeah, roughly a month ago I left the monastery for the first time since childhood. What I've written below reflects that, but we can certainly adjust it if need be.)
		.   Your Exaltation came when you were 15, amidst a very particular sparring match. As a rite of passage, you were to face one of the full monks of the order, and to defeat your opponent (on the first attempt or the 17th) was required to earn your place among them. To your dismay, when the day came, you found yourself facing Brother Jin, well known for his martial prowess, who you were to face again and again until you defeated him, a seemingly impossible task.
		.   Your fears were realized as, from the moment the match started, Brother Jin began delivering a savage beating. It wasn't right! How could you be expected to defeat a seasoned warrior who still stood nearly a foot taller than you? You weren't sure you could be expected _to walk away from this_.
		.   You know now that you weren't expected to ever win. Your skill in martial arts was your pride, but this was as much a lesson in humility as a test of your abilities, and you were overmatched. Had your greatest talents lain in some other direction, perhaps something more scholarly, the trial would have been different, but you would still have been setup to fail at something at which you excelled. Full admission to the order was to come with the admission of defeat, and the martial version of the trial was thought to be an especially effective and. . . visceral version of the lesson.
		.   Instead of learning your lesson, something altogether more dramatic occurred. You managed to keep your feet, if not your ground, for a few moments into the match, though you were hurting badly and not likely to last much longer. Brother Jin threw a punch meant to end the fight, but, though it struck your face, your flesh was as unyielding stone, and your anima flared for the first time. Quick as lightening, before those watching the bout had fallen to their knees, you were on Brother Jin, stiking him again and again. It took you a moment to realize Jin was no longer resisting, and a longer one to grasp what had happened just happened and why everyone in the room lay prostrate on the floor. Brother Jin walked away with serious injuries, and as one of your most fervent followers.

	What brought you to nexus?
	--------------------------
		.   You were charged by your past incarnations with restoring yourself and the world around you to glory beneath The Unconquered Sun, and raised from a young age to believe in that mission. When you left the monastery, you did so in search of the lore and other remnants of The First Age that could enable you to actually accomplish so immense a goal.
		.   Seeing the outside world for the first time since early childhood, your conviction in your mission was redoubled. You had thought your upbringing and training in the monastery harsh, even brutal, and all for (originally) the station of a humble servant, but you had never experienced real _deprivation_, the needs of the monks being tended to by the manse itself. Outside your hidden valley, you first witnessed lives far worse than that of a well fed servant. The world had fallen far, and something had to be done.
		.   Your monastery being in the mountains of the Marukan Alliance, and Lookshy being a dangerous place for your kind, you headed straight to the nearby city of Nexus. Marked on the maps in your library as the old city of Hollow, those few members of your order who traveled (peddling charms for absent necessities and keeping an eye on the surrounding countryside) warned you it was a far different place today, but also confirmed that you might be able to find First Age artifacts or lore sold there.

	How/why did you meet rishi/hawk?
	--------------------------------
		.   Once in Nexus, you sought out places where First Age remnants were bought and sold. Naive where the outside world is concerned, you encountered many frauds and other scams. More familiar than most with The First Age and well capable of defending yourself, you managed to avoid being taken in by any of them (or worse).
		.   As you learned to recognize more reputable shops and merchants, you found yourself one afternoon perusing a shop's collection of books and scrolls while the shopkeeper spoke with another patron. A book caught your eye, the fifth in a series of guidebooks to The Old Realm, written in it's tongue. The _fifth_, in fact, in a supposedly complete series of _four_, all four of which your monastery had retained copies of.
		.   You called to the shopkeep, asking him what this covered, if it's author had claimed to have set down all he knew of the world in his previous four volumes. It was the other figure that responded, though, saying that it was an _update_, and very useful in his work. He introduced himself as Silver-Tongued Rishi and explained that the author had lived to see the end of The First Age, publishing another volume discussing the changes he had since witnessed in the world.
		.   You confessed you had read the first four, but had been not been aware there was a fifth. It was far less widely published, Rishi explained, in the chaos that closed out the age. Rishi insisted on making a gift of the volume to you, asking only that you meet with him at a later date, after reading it, to discuss certain sections he suspected were later fabrications. Walking you out of the shop, he also seemed to take note of your reaction to his bodyguards, when they fell in around Rishi as he walked out into the street, how you took a defensive stance and the way you looked them over.
		.   After your second meeting with Rishi, where you discussed the book and evaded questions about your education, he offered you a job, explaining that he was a scavenger lord and could alway use more scholars who could read the tongue of The Old Realm, especially ones willing to work out in the field. You were delighted to accept, given your mission. When he introduced you to the first of a particular four others in his employ, people somehow both very strange and very familiar to you, you knew you were indeed where you were supposed to be, and at the true beginning of your journey.

	Who is your family and where are they (and no, no dead familys!) And how do they support themselves?
	---------------------------------
		(Oops. Went deep into a dead family direction long before that prohibition, but it's all part of a suitable surrogate group.)
		.   You were one of the many foundlings taken in by The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon over the centuries. It is how they've propogated their order since the end of The First Age. You were raised by it's disciplined tenets to become a humble monk, guarding the manse of the order's long gone master.
		.   When your Exaltation came as a teenager, you went from expectations of humbleness to the venerated center of attention, heir to the manse, it's treasures, and the service of the order of monks. After that, your education continued to focus on martial arts and occult secrets, but the specifics changed dramatically. Ancient tomes, painstakingly copied again and again over the centuries, were brought forth and you learned the techniques of the Solar Exalted. Your teachers, once harsh authority figures, were now obsequious, but no less infuriating, as you underwent a sorcerous initiation prescribed many centuries ago by your predecessor.
		.   You once had dim memories of your mother, a farm on which you lived, and the morning when she would not awake. After that, you had impressions of hunger, and eventually of a stranger that took you away from there, leaving you in a nearby village, only a few years old. The monk who found you there, bringing you to the order, told you that stranger had done you a favor, though not a large one. If so, the monk did you a far greater one, in bringing you to the monastery and also in retelling to you the circumstances in which you were found whenever he stopped there on his traveling rounds. Those retellings are now all you have left of your life before the monastery, as the memories of your life before, the memories that kept you up at night, wondering what was and what could have been, were what you sacrificed in your sorcerous initiation. You'd press that monk again for details, as you had again and again for years, but, when you were eleven and before your Exaltation, he did not return from his rounds when expected, and was never seen again.
		.   The monastery and it's order are the only home you really have, and they're very dear to you. You may lament their foibles, but that doesn't change that they're home and family to you.

	Finally, what is one cultural tradition you follow? Roughly greek or japanese style, like praying or leaving offerings at shrines, bathing daily, refraining from eating specific things, dressing a certain way, shaving your head, that kind of thing.
	---------------------------------
		.   You dress in loose, flowing clothing, and keep your head shaved. Both are marks of your upbringing in The Order of the Dragon Over the Horizon. While the former retains practical benefits for you, the latter had been a strict requirement of the members of the order, novices and monks alike, a symbol of their humility. You suppose you no longer _need_ to keep your head shorn, but you've grown used to it, and it quickly bothers you if left to grow out.
	(In the course of writing up the above, I swapped my two dots in War for a dot in Investigate and a second dot in Lore. It seemed to both make this character more Twilight-flavored, vs. the original Dawn caste, and to better suit his increasingly fleshed out back story and relationship with Rishi. I hope that's OK!)


4/26/21:
	-Sounds like I've had a dream, as now recorded in my character sheet in Roll20 too:
		-"Dreams of the first age: you remember standing in a circle of power surrounded by Elementals kneeling in prostration. They offer you Porcelan masks each bearing the inscription of a name, you know these contain the sould of your favored servants, who sacrificed their bodies to serve forever. you know the magic used to create these were your greatest accomplishment."
	-We've all been summoned to Rishi's estate.
		-One of his runner's came to collect me.
		-Rishi's estate is right on the border of the Firewander district's wyld zone.
			-It's walled and surrounded by four white jade pillars from which prayer banners dangle,
			 stabilizing the area.
	-Rishi always goes about wrapped in bandages, and is said to be disfigured beneath it.
		-Some name him "Clayface", as the tale is that one of the Fae had disfigured, molding his
		 body like clay.
	-Hawk invariably wears fine, shining plate. His skin is pale, making the contrast with his bright
	 blue eyes all the more dramatic.
	-Rishi has a proposal for us.
		-Recently, a trio of death knights were killed within the city's borders.
		-They were carrying something important, and came to meet another death knight.
			-The other is in service to "The Walker in Darkeness".
		-So much necrotic energy in one area attracted the attention of sorcerers.
			-Lord Hilo, who resides in the Cinnabar district, is rumored to be the one who carried
			 out the attack on them.
		-The lone remaining death knight is said to hold information leading to an ancient manse.
			-Rishi wishes us to look into this. If it bears fruit, he will give us each a half talen
			 of jade (equivalent of Resources 3). If not, he'll give us half that (Resources 2).
			-Rishi must not be implicated, though, as he and Hylo share an ally who would be wroth
			 if Rishi were discovered working against Hilo.
	-We made our introductions while enjoying Rishi's food, and then headed to The East Canal to
	 take a gondola to The Cinnabar District.
		-Once outside of Firewander, where wyld mutant attacks are less of a concern, the buildings
		 grew nicer and nicer, even giving way to many surviving First Age buildings.
		-By the time we debarked, the very cobblestones in the street seemed polished and without
		 flaw.
		-In the sky above, we could see the silver-masked Emissary watching over the city below.
	-We headed to the general location in which we were told Lord Hilo's estate was to be found.
		-We saw guards standing outside one building, quite similar to those that guard the slave
		 pits.
			-The bore a device on their shield, a cracked tower atop a mountain, the emblem of the
			 "Broken Tower Family", a noble family in the scavenger lands.
				-They have a dark reputation, and are said to have ties to organized crime.
		-We wracked our brains for an option for talking our way inside.
			-Libak suggested a name, Diban of the Northern Wolves, a slaver who recently drank
			 himself to death, a thing not yet widely known.
			-We approached the guards and Libak claim himself to be a representative of Diban.
			-They bought the story, and allowed us in.
	-A dark tunnel led into Hilo's estate.
		-Golden Blade lit a torch, as the oil lamps that were installed in much of the city
		 seem to be missing down here.
		-We could hear skittering in the darkness outside of the radius of our light. . .
		-Heading down the tunnel, we reached a part that was barricaded by a crude wall of
		 trash.
		-Turning back and down another branch, the passage dead ended at three valves, two hot
		 and in good repair, while the third was rusted and chained in place with a lock.
			-Silent Onyx was able to figure out the puzzle lock, and removed the chain.
			-Turning it probably wasn't the wisest thing we could of done, as the tunnel behind
			 us then began to fill with steam reeking of rotten eggs.
			-Pip called for us to extinguish our torches, and then illuminated her caste mark!
				-(Another) Solar Exalted! An Eclipse caste.
		-Holding our breath, we ran through the foul steam, thankfully unharmed.
			-Hearing more skittering, Libak too illuminated a (Zenith) caste mark)!
		-Golden Blade burst that barricade, revealing another cloud of gas behind it.
			-We're thinking it's the gas meant to fuel the missing lamps.
		-Golden Blade thought he saw something moving in the cloud ahead of us. . .
		-Pip loosed an arrow into the gas, and was greeted with a chorus of shrieks.
		-The subsequent thrashing cleared much of the gas revealing a tangled swarm of rats,
		 still shrieking, and moving as if one mass.
			-Quick as a serpant, I darted forward, pulping three of the rats with my fists.
			-Silent Onyx joined me, cutting down more of the rats, until the swarm moved no more.
			-Onyx had heard stories when he was younger about "mythical" rat kings that live beneath
			 Nexus.
		-Continuing on, we came to a great, though awful smelling, chamber.
			-It featured a pool and several valves, but we left these well enough alone.
		-Heading North down the tunnel leading from that chamber, we came to a crossroads and
		 turned left.
		-It took us to a chamber with a door that _could_ have been concealed, built as it was
		 with clever mechanisms that would close flush with the wall, but it was partly open.
			-Inside was a ladder leading upwards, to some kind of large cave.
			-Within the cave, a fortress had been constructed.
				-Very fitting for a criminal citadel, and in line with what we were told of
				 Hilo's estate.
				-Torch and glowing clusters of quartz ("glowstones") lit the cavern as if by
				 moonlight.
				-We resolved to split up for a bit, most of us continuing the pretense of being
				 emissaries from Diban, while Silent Onyx scaled the walls of the castle, hoping
				 to have a stealthy look around.
		-A guard answered our knock and allowed the remaining four of us into the fortress, after
		 we told him we were a delegation from Diban.
			-He asked that we leave our weapons at a room near the entrance, which the others
			 complied with while I indicated I was unarmed.
		-The guard then led us into an audience with Lord Hilo, who was watching a jester while a
		 geisha mixed a drink and a samurai with a white-jade powerbow stood guard.
			-Libak claimed we represented Diban, and announced that he sought information on a manse,
			 offering goods or coin in exchange.
			-Hilo sent away his fool and geisha, and then asked us where we'd heard he possessed
			 such information.
			-Libak told him the things we'd heard concerning the the fight with the death knights.
			-Lord Hilo again demanded that we tell him who we worked for, but Libak said now that
			 our employer did not wish to be named.
			-Hilo seemed a bit taken aback that we were somewhat upfront about that, but he asked us
			 to tell him we at least did not work for a death knight.
				-While he did so, his eyes rippled, and water. . . _emerged_ from them, hanging there.
					-To me, it seemed like some Terrestrial Charm.
					-Perhaps to discern truth? He had _each_ of us disclaim death knight employment.
				-We all did so.
			-He asked what we offered in payment, for this valueable information.
				-Libak rambled off several options, including _service_.
				-Service seemed to catch his attention, and he dismissed his guards, including the
				 samurai, who smelled strongly of freshly turned earth as he walked past us.
				-Hilo emphasized again the great value of this information, talking of those who
				 fell in battle against the death knights, including his son-in-law.
				-Hilo wanted _vengeance_, the remaining death knight dead, but he hides in Nexus's
				 Wyld Zone, where none of his men would venture.
					-Mutation is likely, if we do, though there are ways to guard against it and
					 other hazards of the wild. Rishi, in fact, is known for such things.
				-We asked Lord Hilo what he could tell us of the death knight.
					-He described the monster to us, masked in a terrible shrieking deathmask of
					 black metal and always wrapped in strips of black leather, but said that was
					 all that he knew.
					-Golden Blade claimed that he was lying about that last bit. He's keeping
					 something from us.
					-Libak attempted to shame him on that score, as we had, afterall, been as honest
					 as we could be, but his efforts were in vain.
					-We accepted the deal, and took our leave of him.
		-As we left, Silent Onyx soon joined us, jumping down from the walls after we crossed the
		 drawbridge.
			-We returned to Rishi's, and then we caught each other up.
				-Rishi, though, had gone somewhere with Hawk, and had been unsure how long he'd be
				 gone.
			-Silent Onyx told us the rooms above seemed far too empty, though Golden Blade pointed
			 out that there _was_ supposed to be a funeral going on, which may explain it.
			-He also had found an ear with strangely regular markings.
				-I was able to interpret the code. It stated that, "If others of my circle should
				 find this, let The Mask know I have failed."
				-Golden Blade suggested this may be The Mask of Winters, who rules Thorns.
				-Death knights are the vanguards of the armies of the death lords. They're rather
				 Solar-like.
					-Golden Blade had even encountered one, and it had a caste mark, though it
					 glowed _red_.
					-They're murderers, and definitely not folks we want to deliver a message for.


-TODO:
	-Figure out how we might enter the wild.
		-Tougher than otherwise, with Rishi gone, but Nexus isn't a bad place to research the
		 subject.
	-Figure out if you should let the others know you're a Solar.
		-Pip (Eclipse) and Libak (Zenith) have both illuminated their marks, and Golden Blade (Dawn)
		 has been open about it with the Hawke and his employees, such that you could easily find out.
		-Perhaps raise it at the beginning of next session, roleplaying a tentative reveal?
	-Have your motes all come back?
		-Even an hour at Rishi's would would more than suffice.


5/10/21:
	-Back at Rishi's estate, we discussed our next moves.
		-I'd already worked with Rishi for a bit, and have access to his library, but it's more
		 focused on First Age remnants than The Wyld.
		-Libak suggested that the city's library may hold more.
		-Silent Onyx was more in favor of throat cutting, returning to Hilo's estate and taking the
		 information we need from corpses.
		-I also, playing a bit dumb, asked Libak and Pip what those symbol's they displayed in the
		 sewers were.
			-Libak all but admitted to being a Solar Exalted.
			-I cautioned them to keep such things under wraps, particularly in light of Lord Hilo
			 and one of his attendants being dragonborn.
	-We opted to head to the City Library, to further research the hazards of The Wyld.
		-It's one of Nexus's First Age structures, comprised of the usual white harder-than-marble
		 and much gilt.
		-They had a whole section covering The Wyld, but when Golden Blade asked about books
		 that might tell us more about The Mask of Winters, the attendant said there was little,
		 though he did mention there were many works on ghosts in general.
		-We headed to The Wyld section, and began reading through what was available.
			-It took us a couple of hours, but we managed to confirm that iron against our skin
			 would indeed protect us, but also that Exalted have varying degrees of resistance to
			 the energies of The Wyld.
			-Short excursions into Wyld Zones bordering creation might be largely safe for a Solar
			 Exalted.
			-As a border march, Nexus's Wyld Zone is relatively constant. It has been covered by an
			 eternal thunderstorm for the last thousand years, and is filled with rain washed First
			 Age ruins.
				-The lightening blasted ruins are a strange contrast to the still immaculate First
				 Age buildings in the rest of Nexus.
		-We were also curious about the general properties of ghosts, in the name of sizing up The
		 Mask of Winters to some extent.
			-Golden Blade, in particular.
			-Exorcists deal with ghosts via the thaumaturgical Art of Exorcism, but they can also
			 be locked in a ring of salt, and exposure to true daylight will destroy them.
				-The Mortician's Guild of Sijan are famed exorcists, though far from here.
	-We then sought out our wrought iron, heading to the market district.
		-We procured for ourselves a set of wrought iron rings.
		-Thinking of the rain, we also picked up a set of hooded lanterns.
	-We then returned to Rishi's estate to rest, before setting out.
	-Late that night, just before midnight, we heard the sound of Rishi's return.
		-Crashing noises and shouting called us from our rooms on the estate, and we saw a very
		 drunk Hawke and Rishi.
		-Hawke was throttling Rishi, demanding he "take it back!"
			-He claimed Rishi had called him a coward, and threw Rishi to the ground.
		-Rishi said that Hawke, "is a mean drunk! I told you we should have stayed away from that
		 devil rum!"
		-Golden Blade did a solid job of defusing the situation by asking if they'd brought any of
		 the rum back (lol).
		-He and Hawke set to drinking, while Libak helped Rishi back to his room.
			-Pretty soon, Hawke was passed out on a bench and could not be moved.
	-The next morning, we were waken by servants with breakfast.
		-Hawke too, who seemed none to thrilled by the wake up.
		-Rishi, by contrast, was already up, painting a psychedelic female nude.
			-Apparently it's his mom, who had a dream about last night.
			-She was one of the fae.
	-An odd coincidence, I said, and told him of the deal Lord Hilo offered.
		-Rishi indeed knew the Wyld well, and had an offer of help, though for one of us only.
		-He had a servant bring forth a white jade torc, which he said would maintain a zone of
		 stability around the wearer in the zone.
			-We opted to give the torc to Silent Onyx, who would be well suited to scouting the
			 zone, to minimize the time we need spend in there unprotected.
		-He also warned us to avoid the golden dome inside. No bordermarch, within, Rishi said,
		 lay pure chaos.
	-Silent Onyx set out into the zone, while we waited in Rishi's estate, right on it's border.
		-A short time after he left, we saw a great bolt of lightening above the golden dome, which
		 turned into a flaming chariot.
		-Soon after, plants began to grow all around the zone, twisting into enormous monsters that
		 began to wander the zone.
			-Silent Onyx needed help.
		-I ran to my room, to gather my things, and to also cast Wood Dragon's Claw. Then, drawing
		 my arms into the sleeves of my cloak, I returned to the others, and we set out into the
		 zone.
	-The moment we stepped into the Wyld Zone, we were somehow swiftly drawn further into the zone.
		-It was as if we were torn from a painting, dragged further in, with the local scenery coming
		 with.
		-We then heard a voice, speaking of heroes who went to save their comrade, but who were beset
		 by monsters. We _saw_ the monsters, but they seemed somehow unreal. Or, at least, to all of
		 us save Pip, who flailed beneath their immaterial blows, as one snatched away one of her
		 possessions, a staff.
		-In the distance, we saw Silent Onyx, but he was knocked into the air by a blast, thrown out
		 of the zone.
		-We ran towards him, but again heard the voice. It spoke of the heroes rushing to their
		 friend's side, but also of a golem that would not let them bass.
		-Sure enough, a 15' tall humanoid figure of rough hewn glass barred our way, blocking us no
		 matter how we tried to circle around it.
		-No way out but through, then, so I cast another spell, Invulnerable Skin of Bronze.
		-With that, my anima flared, a blazing pillar of light.
			-Guess the circle knows I'm a solar now.
		-That provoked a reaction from the voice, which spoke of a "daikaiju" that struck me down,
		 grinding my flesh to paste.
			-Uh oh.
			-The golem than struck me with a mighty blow, smashingly me into a cartoonishly me-shaped
			 hole in the pavement.
			-My sorcerously fortified skin seems to have saved me, though, as I climbed out of the
			 hole unharmed.
		-A beautiful golden figure then descended from the clouds, a horned woman.
			-She said that I was "worthy", able to stand before the strongest of her "daikaiju".
			-She said it had been a very long time since such heroes had entered her realm.
				-"Oh?", I asked, "For we came seeking another who hides here."
				-"The Mistress? Emissary of The Mask of Winters?"
				-"That sounds like the one."
			-She then offered a deal. She said she had tested The Mistress, but found her wanting,
			 and took her heart. She offered it to me, in exchange for swearing myself her enemy
			 until the end of time.
				-"One day, my armies shall issue forth, slaughtering all before them. You will
				 stand in opposition to my monsters."
				-How could I do otherwise than stand against such a tide? I accepted the deal, taking
				 from the golden figure a red crystal wrapped in barbed wire and thorned vines.
				-I took it with one of my clawed hands, and immediately became intensely aware of
				 the Death Knight. She felt angry. . . but helpless.
			-To Onyx, she offered a deal as well, desiring his hate. In exchange, he was given a 
			 scroll, one that seemed to contain a spell from the glance I saw, and also the promise
			 of a grisly death at her hands.
			-Things seemed to have gone more or less well, but Pip was quite aggrieved by the loss
			 of her staff, an item the figure was all too happy taunt her with, after she mentioned
			 it.
				-She offered it's return, in exchange for Pip's heart (a rather poor deal).
				-Impetuously, Golden Blade proposed a duel instead, for the staff, which the figure
				 gladly accepted. He will duel a kaiju.


-TODO:
	-Ask the golden figure her name.
		-"I must know the name of my new enemy, the name I will curse and swear vendetta against!"
		-Done: "The Mother Horrors, Muse of War, The Eternal Darkness That Will Blanket Creation."


5/24/21: Golden Blade vs. Kaiju!
	-I asked Lesley about how the world views the fey-descended, like Rishi: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/846489725824270354
		-Not the condemnation that Solars face, so probably not a case of mutually assured
		 destruction between the two of us, as I'd been hoping.
		-Nonetheless, they're feared and reviled, a people generally believe they fey want to eat
		 their souls.
	-The faerie began discussing the terms of the duel.
		-Her terms: "We will fight without shaping magics."
		-Golden Blade's: "We will fight on solid ground."
		-Her next: "You shall wear no iron during the combat."
			-Golden Blade was. . . less than enthusiastic about that one.
				-"You should talk with my attorney," he said, and Libak stepped in to argue.
				-Libak tapped his staff, calling attention to himself, and launched into an argument
				 that this proposal was _not_, in fact, fair!
					-As he did so, he slowly began to glow. . . 
					-Looks like _all_ of us five are Solars! (Who'd've thought?!?)
				-The fay agreed, but demanded in exchange that Blade then not be allowed to use
				 weapons.
				-Libak talked her into an alternate offer: "If you must have your weapon, than I
				 shall be allowed sorcery."
				-That we assented to, so her final term was no god or Wyld gifts.
					-Instead, Libak countered with an offer that Blade instead not attack for the
					 first three rounds, to which she assented.
				-Silent Onyx got frustrated with all the waiting and took the complacent deathknight
				 out of the zone with him, back to his home in Nexus.
					-I'm pretty confident I can follow the heart back to them.
		-With that, the terms of the contest were settled.
			-The golden figure instructed the rest of us to stand back, as she hereself drew back to
			 a nearyby rooftop.
			-I had a question, though: "I must know the name of my new enemy, the name I will curse
			 and swear vendetta against, and the name I shall root against here."
				-The Mother of Horrors, Muse of War, The Eternal Darkness That Will Blanket Creation.
			-Blade then set about battling the kaiju champion.
				-He seemingly had it defeated when it dissolved into a cloud of obsidian butterflies,
				 only to reform in the air above.
					-I noticed an amethyst butterfly among them, one that seemed to carry the spell
					 into the sky.
					-Pip, though, called The Mother of Horrors out, saying she had deceived us, and
					 was herself engaged in the battle. She winced at each blow, and lines of
					 essence formed on her body.
						-The two of them, along with Libak, then engaged in a philosophical debate
						 about whether that's cheating or not.
						-Things finally clicked for me (I finally rolled half decent on Int+Occult)
						 and I realized that, despite no more visible wounds, it could not heal the
						 blows a creature of Creation that easily and, futher, that the iron may be
						 a better weapon than the blade.
						-I shouted reassurances to Golden Blade that he had this, and told him to use
						 the iron.
					-Ringed punches didn't go so well, but Golden Blade bent the ring over his sword
					 and then made short work of the kaiju.
					-Enraged, Golden Blade then strode towards the faerie.
						-"If the kaiju was you, you're in this!"
						-At that, she called the staff to her hand and threw it down, admitting
						 defeat.
						-Golden Blade was not appeased, though. . .
							-I shrugged at the thought of my new enemy's demise, but Pip and Libak
							 ran to intervene.
							-Libak broke Blade's charge, thowing himself between him and the fay,
							 while Pip even struck his blade with an arrow, attempting to disarm
							 him.
							-They set to arguing, and the fay took to the opportunity to dissolve
							 into goo and disappear, promising to one day rip off Golden Blade's
							 limbs as she went.
	-Well, that was pretty much a success!
		-Garn said as much as we walked back out of the Wyld zone.
		-As we reached the barriers at it's edges, the white stones, I could feel some. . . resistance
		 as I pulled the heart-crystal through the barrier with me.
		-We exited where we entered, at the edge of Rishi's estate.
	-I found I no longer had a sense of the deathknight's location, but the "heart" tugged at my
	 essence, not unlike my artifact bracers. I could attune to this.
		-Finding an available room at Rishi's estate, I took 20 minutes to attune a mote to the
		 artifact.
		-I was then beset by visions, visions in which I was her.
			-Falling in a hail of arrows on a battlefield.
			-A masked figure, skull-faced and befeathered, with another mask on the back of it's
			 head, offering her a quill, with which she signed something.
				-The Mask of Winters.
			-Another of her leading an army of undead, towards the Marukani Foothills.
			-Finally, her weeping tears of blood, as the fay reached down her throat and tore out
			 this heart.
		-Then attuned, for 1 mote committed, I could again feel a pull towards the deathknight.
			-I also could sense more options, were I to pour a bit, a moderate amount, or a lot.
		-I relayed the visions to the others, and Golden Blade recognized the army as a force
		 involved in the conquest of Thorns.
			-History, then. Comforting, as an undead army on the march near my manse would be cause
			 for grave alarm.
		-We flagged down a rickshaw, following the tug I felt to the Sentinel's Hill district.
			-The rickshaw for a badly beat Blade's comfort.
			-Winding through it's streets, we came to a warehouse with apartments above.
			-Golden Blade had called for a victory drink on the ride over, and a pub on the corner
			 was calling our names, so I suggested he and I go grab some drinks to go while Libak
			 and Pip ask around to see if anyone knows where Onyx lives.
		-By the time Golden Blade and I had a jug of unspecified booze, the others were nowhere to
		 be seen, but we could hear voices inside the warehouse.
			-I called out, and they came out to collect us.
		-Inside, Silent Onyx had apparently been torturing the deathknight, though to no avail as
		 she only stared, glassy eyed.
			-I tried the first, smallest expenditure of essence (2 motes) fed to the heart, and found
			 myself looking out from her eyes, moving her hands instead of mine.
			-Attempting the second, 5 motes, she was briefly lucid, and answered one question, when
			 I asked her name.
				-The Mistress of Pacts Sealed in Blood.
				-She seemed greatly distressed, with a single tear rolling down her cheek.
			-Finally, with the expenditure of 10 motes, she became somewhat more independently lucid.
				-A bit worrying, and she did indeed express a desire to murder the lot of us, but
				 said she could not raise her hand to do so.
					-The tears continued at this.
				-Now, she was answering multiple questions and volunteering information.
				-She told us she came here to meet with the other three deathknights and pool
				 information with them.
					-The others were Shoat of the Mire, Endless Apostate Fed to the Wolves, and The
					 Dowager, the last actually being a _deathlord_.
				-Some letters had been discovered to the far North, of interest to her master, The
				 Mask of Winters.
					-Old love letters, they also concerned a manse, somehow removed from Creation,
					 hidden in the shadow of it's own Essence.
					-Her master had known the author.
					-Sounds like what we were looking for.
				-The dragonborn had been indirect in their assault on the deathknights, though, out
				 of fear for the Abyssals and used catapults and trebuchets to collapse the building
				 they were in.
					-She claimed (and believed, according to Libak's charm) that the letters were
					 surely destroyed, but that she held the information still, in her mind.
					-Though she said she was powerless to deny it to us, she still asked that, in
					 exchange for the information, we free her, and that she would do us no harm in
					 return, traveling far from here (again, the truth).
					-We ended the session there.


TODO:
	-Oh! To decide what to do with our death knight, I can ask her about herself!
		-I've already seen a vision of what could very accurately be construed as a dire crime,
		 leading that undead army on Thorns.
			-This is also something you can look into elsewhere, asking Golden Blade or around Nexus
			 what exactly happened at Thorns.
	-_Is_ this the death knight Hilo sent us after? Don't know that she sounds like the description.
		-Search "We asked Lord Hilo what he could tell us of the death knight"


6/21/21:
	-We need to know more about the Abyssals.
		-A 4 on Int+Lore told me:
			-Reports of these "deathknights" first began around the fall of Thorns.
			-They largely lived up to the reputation of the "Anathema" all Solars are said to be.
			-The serve powerful ghosts, called "deathlords".
				-Two deathlords known by name in Nexus are The Mask of Winters and The Walker in
				 Darkness.
				-They've raised small armies in the past, to test the defenses of Nexus.
	-We then asked The Mistress about the letters.
		-They were love letters between a Solar and his Lunar lover.
			-Written by Ozandus Pal to the wolf-beast Mithra.
				-Our destination on the map lies in "Mithra's Domain", but you're not certain that's
				 the name you heard Lesley say.
		-They also spoke of the manse, the last wonder by Kalbax, the very one who had worked on the
		 imperial manse.
			-Within is the body of The Walker in Darkness.
				-When asked what her master intended to do with it, she said it's rumored that only
				 with their body could a deathlord be truely destroyed.
			-Shoat of the Mire, one of the other deathknights, had a map from his patron, leading to
			 the manse, but it could not be decoded without information from the letters.
				-She claimed to possess a eiditic memory, and having seen them, was able to replicate
				 them for us, given paper.
					-She did so with some kind of (literally) bloody charm.
				-It pointed to a location far to the Northeast, a place along the river there, known
				 as Wangler's Knob.
					-It's some 3000 miles away, though.
			-Asked if this could indeed find us the manse, she warned us it's near undetectable but
			 that, following the path, we would eventually arrive at it.
	-We're rather unsure what to do about her.
		-We do seem inclined to hold onto her for the moment, until this manse is really in hand.
		-A lengthy expedition to the far Northeast makes it. . . complicated to leave her somewhere.
	-We wanted to talk to Rishi about his next move, so headed to Rishi's estate, leaving her at
	 Onyx's for the moment.
		-When we arrived, Hawke was there too, with 5 of his soldiers, talking to Rishi out front.
		-One of the street facing windows of the estate was broken.
		-Asking if everything was OK, Rishi ushered us inside, telling us that things had become more
		 complicated.
		-Inside, Hawke asked Rishi if he was _sure_ that Hilo was not responsible for the assassin. . .
			-No, Rishi told him the man bore the markings of The Guild.
		-Rishi _did_ seem concerned about Hilo, though. He had heard rumors that Hilo might possess
		 information leading to a cache of First Age artifacts, presumably the manse we seek.
			-He may sell it to another party, perhaps even The Guild.
		-We told Rishi, though, that we, at least, certainly did have the information.
			-We went inside and unfurled the map, and told him of Wangler's Knob.
			-We then began discussions of outfitting a ship.
				-He suggested that we disappear in the meantime, getting out of the city.
					-He'd be doing the same, and best none of us can reveal the other.
				-Rishi said a ship bearing yellow crosses on the prow would be ready in a week at the
				 Nighthammer docks, and would wait only another week if we are late.
	-We then swung by Hawke's estate to get Golden Blade patched up, and then back to Onyx's to
	 discuss our next move.
		-I largely had the circle convinced to disappear to a town I knew of, not far from the manse.
		-We headed to the docks in persuit of that, seeking a boat to take us a short distance West,
		 before heading South overland towards Marukan.
			-I handed the heart off to Pip as we left, as I was short on motes, and we needed her
			 cooperation.
		-Reaching the docks, though, with a cloaked deathknight in tow, we found no _immediately_
		 convenient boat, and many of the party got very interested in convenient ships to Great
		 Forks.
			-We eventually agreed I'd set out on my own, claiming "business to attend to" and "family
			 in the hills".
			-Great Forks turned out to be party town, with every day a raucous celebration honoring a
			 different god. I missed out. :(
	-Meanwhile, I made my way home.
		-The mortician's were happy to help, in exchange only for 2 dinars towards an
		 unfortunate's burial costs.
			-We picked up corpses at a ruined fort accross the river, many branded with the
			 symbol marking The Mask of Winter's spies.
			-At an inlet along the Yanaze, they stopped to receive corpses raised up from the
			 river by fish and lobster people, their mouths, noses, and eyes packed with salt,
			 paying in silver coin for their burial.
			-I took my leave of them there, scaling the high cliffs of the river bank there
			 via some rickety ladders leading up from the inlet, heading South towards home.
		-Along the way overland, I saw a great, rainbow light, to the South past the hills.
		-Arriving, finally and exhausted, at the mance, I greeted my monks, and only
		 companions for most of my life.
			-They informed me that a strange beast, coming East from Mishaka, had attacked the manse.
				-Some sort of elemental or god, it had the skull of an elk for a head, long, clawed
				 arms on it's tiny frame, and split ribs revealing the cavity it's heart should have
				 been. It seemed to be fond of flaying.
				-They were able to defeat it, but only with the help of _another_ visitor, a red caped 
				 swordsman who arrived as it did.
				-Their memories of the swordsman were strangely clouded, though. They could not
				 remember his name or features.
			-The violation of the sacred manse was profoundly troubling.
			-I had, though, good news for them, telling them of the potential first age cache I am on
			 the trail of.
			-I warned them, though, that I'd also be gone a long while, off in search of it.
		-After resting the night of my arrival, I set about doing what I came to, and learned a new
		 spell, Spoke the Wooden Face.
			-Choosen, in part, in reaction to the intrusion.
			-I unfortunately cannot take the contents of my library from the manse, inscribed as it
			 is on strange crystal tablets, useable only within the manse's boundaries. This spell
			 also resolves that, as I can have my monks hold them up to the tree.
			-I did indeed perform one casting of the spell, having had my monks uproot and pot a small
			 tree from within the manse's grounds. It can now be moved inside as needed.
		-I eventually took my leave of the manse, and headed North again, overland.
			-On the way, in the distance ahead, I saw a red caped figure.
				-Red themed in general.
			-Striding towards him, I did fall into Snake Form and engage my Essence Fangs
			 and Scales Technique, but then greeted him.
				-He greeted me as "Master of the Fort", and asked me, "Do you know that you
				 are destined to fight in a great battle?"
				-I acknowledged that I was indeed raised to believe a great fate lay before
				 me.
				-He said that, at the end of the battle, when fate becomes cloudy, and many
				 things are possible, that I would encounter a great darkness.
				-It may be that I release the great darkness upon the land, but there is also
				 some chance I may master it, building a great empire of gold.
				-He also spoke of a great plague in the land and, as he walked away, shouted
				 one last time: "Beware the birds."
		-The remainder of the trip back to Nexus was uneventful.
			-I was able to catch a ride with a fisherman, in exchange for work.
			-A independent garum making operation, it was a smelly last leg of the journey,
			 but Garn is not oppose to turning his hands to labor.
	-Upon reuniting with the party, I told them my journey had been gnomic and smelly.
		-Theirs, they told me, was quite literally a party, save a strange encounter on the trip home.
		-A boat full of pirates delivered them a dramatic message, tossing a scroll aboard that said,
		 "Beware the birds."
		-At that, I started, and revealed that I too had receieved a similar message.
		-We soon figured out their boat also held a red caped figure. It seems we perhaps encountered
		 the same person.
		-Or, perhaps, _creature_, given his strange appearance and the powers he displayed.
			-With an Occult roll, I thought there was lots of things he could have been. A little god,
			 a fairy in disguise, a demon. . .
		-I relayed to them the contents of my own, more detailed warning.
	-With me finally aboard, we quickly set out, aboard four ships.
		-We took the ships down river, past Sijan.
		-Passing a great forest on the right bank, we heard strange and terrifying noises coming from
		 the forest. Screams, screechs, and sometimes the sound of battle.
		-As three of the ships steered towards the left, looking to take aboard more fresh water, the
		 fourth instead slowly veered to the right, running aground on the forested side's bank.
			-What the hell were they doing? Pip shouted to the crew of our own ship, aided by a charm,
			 ordering them to follow and rescue them.
			-As we arrived on the right bank, we saw the ships crew, slowly walking into the forest.
			-Golden Blade shouted to them. Only one of them turned, though, and his face was largely
			 torn away. He simply stood there, chittering strangely.
			-I said that I suspect the crew was beyond saving. . .
			-What though of the soldier, below deck? We ran to the ship, opening one of the hatches.
			-In response, we heard shouts that, "They're coming back! Get back in the circle!"
			-We shouted that it was us, not whatever became of the crew.
			-One of the soldiers had apparently been a veteran of Thorns, and knew the hungry dead
			 could not cross salt. He scattered it in a circle about his fellows.
			-We lead the shaken soldiers onto our own ship, and headed on.
	-A few days more down the river, one of the sailors was lighting a cookfire on a metal plate on
	 deck, heating some water, only for the cookpot to suddenly grow to many times it's size, and a
	 nude, incredibly hairy, Danny Devito looking man with an enormous dick emerged.
		-"Cooking military rations, eh? I love military boys!"
		-He claimed to be the god of manly challenges, and cookfires, and asked who'd face him in a
		 drinking contest! If we could best him, he'd bless our cookpots to alway produce delicious
		 food, and ask nothing should he win.
			-Golden Blade was game, and the god soon hauled an enormous cask of liquor from the
			 cookpot.
			-Golden Blade, with some Willpower, pulled off a shocking victory, and the god was as
			 good as his word. The next batch of rations from the pot tasted _fantastic_.
	-Further down the river, moving into the realm of the Linowan, the river grew more and more
	 crowded.
		-As we arrived at the town of Wangler's Knob, in addition to the Iriquois-looking Linowan,
		 we saw evidence of a presence from The Realm. We saw the markings of House Cessus, and
		 Realm legionnaires walking around.
		-Docking, Pip apparently noticed someone she recognized on the docks.
			-Apparently she had admitted to the captain of the vessel they returned from Great Forks
			 on that she was a Solar Exalted, with a poor reaction on his part.
			-The captain saw her too, and disappeared into the crowded streets. Shit.
			-I was less than thrilled by this, especially given the Realm presence here.
			-She ran off, claiming she'll talk to him.
		-Meanwhile, we went to confer with Rishi, about our next step.
			-He had negotiated with the harbor master for some space near the docs to setup shop.
			-There, inside a tent, we got some time alone with him, as he poured over books on the
			 Linowan, the Halta, and fragments of First Age records.
			-He too was concerned by the unusually far out Realm presence, fearing they came for what
			 we seek.
			-He suggested we seek information on their presence, noting they would likely deal largely
			 with diplomats and the town's governor.
				-That was well within Libak's remit, and we got to it, asking around town
				-The name Taltoc came up, a former soldier who's said to be working with the dynasts.
					-Members of The Wyld Hunt are said to be in the area hunting a monster that had
					 been terrorizing the area, The Wendigo.
				-Miles Wangler is the current governor, but he's rumored to be getting strong armed
				 by Sesus Lahor, who's pushing for more and more concessions to the dynasts.
				-The Madam is another power in town, amongst the tents rather than the nobles'
				 longhouses. She seems to be seeking some kind of workers' rebellion, against the
				 nobles and tradors, and she is said to have a blue robed servant, with a white sparrow
				 stitched on his breast, that terrorizes the town.
					-She herself is supposedly Dragonblooded.
			-Well, that at least suggests they're not (yet) here for us or the manse.
			-We returned to Rishi, to share this.
				-They'd heard some of the same.
				-Rishi termed the city a powder keg, and Hawke suggested leaving it, but Rishi warned
				 against that, saying the wilderness around us feature several Wyld Zones, and that it
				 would be best to stay within the city's wards againt the fay.
				-Rishi suggested we'd best scout ahead, attracting less attention than moving in force.
					-I asked that, in finding it, what should we do? Send for him?
					-He offered up a jade disk, one of a pair. Speaking through the whole in the center
					 of one disks, his voice echoed forth from the other.
					-I claimed it.
				-We were happy to agree, and began gathering supplies, leaving off there for the night.
			-Oh, on Pip's return, she offered only faint reassurance that our. . . nature was still
			 unknown here. She _did_ see the captain with a legionnaire.


TODO:
	-Uh, that Abyssal is still with us, right? Didn't really come up on the boat trip, but what are
	 we going to do with her as we now set out.
		-I don't think we could have managed to keep her a secret on the boat either.

7/12/21:
	-We resolved my TODO above, about the Abyssal, and did indeed bring her with on the boat.
		-Apparently Libak told Rishi she was an unfortunate victim of the fey, and also our source of
		 information about the manse. Best to keep her near and safe, in case we have further questions.
	-Given the presence of legionnaires and a Wyld Hunt, we all felt it best to get out of town, and
	 opted to take Rishi's suggestion to scout ahead in search of the manse.
	-As such, we made our preparations:
		-We picked up gear and, with a lowest Resources of 2, we all have:
			climbing kit
			crampons (removes penalty for walking on ice)
			fur lined boots, cap, cloak, gloves, waterproofed sleeping bag
			sled
			Snow Bling Goggles
			Snowshoes
			Waterproofed Rope (200FT)
			Waterproofed tarp, tent
			Waterproofing agent (1qt)
		-We also considered hiring a guide, though I had my reservations about letting anyone else
		 near the manse.
			-It proved a moot point, though. This whole affair was born of Orichalcum shards found in
			 the area and, Rishi apparently not being the only one to know of that, the town is
			 packed with treasure hunters. The only guide we found had body guards at the door turning
			 away any that could not offer many talens of jade, a vastly inflated price.
	-We thought it best to avoid being seen leaving the city, and sought to duck out one of the tent
	 city's back alley.
		-Silent Onyx guided us, sneaking ahead as necessary to find a path, and we were able to leave
		 unseen, by either the town guards or the Immaculate soldiers.
	-Immediately outside the bounds of the town, dense forest began.
		-Though it's still Fall, the trees here are already dusted in snow.
			-The air trapped beneath them at the forest floor was still fairly warm beneath the dense
			 canopy, at least.
		-As we setup camp after the first day's travel East, it clicked for Silent Onyx that, full
		 of treasure hunters as these woods are, we might need to worry about thieves, given that we
		 are, after all, bedecked in golden artifacts ourselves.
			-As such, we set a watch while we camped.
			-I took the third watch and, when Libak woke me, he told me of a strange figure he saw
			 running with deer while he kept watch.
				-It's face was surrounded by a halo of branches growing from it, and from it's
				 footsteps grew vines and flowers.
					-By the time I examined the footsteps after waking, the growth had decayed, and
					 rings of mushrooms had sprouted around each footprint.
				-I recognized the creature as a "treefather", guardians of the forest, and generally
				 benign, so long as you're not threatening their forest.
			-During my own watch, I both saw and felt quite the phenomena, a swirling ribbon of golden
			 essence shooting into the sky, reaching a zenith and flashing white, then falling back
			 to earth colored silver.
				-I was even physically pulled towards it as it crashed back to earth.
				-It was off to the East of us, and I take it to be a sign we're indeed on the right
				 track. It may be essence venting from the manse (and is likely less visible to those
				 with lower essence).
	-We broke camp in the morning and continued on towards where we believe the manse lies.
	-As we walked, we came to a clearing, where a monk waited.
		-Red robed and with red-jade gladiuses on his hip, I recognized him as an Immaculate Monk.
			-Silent Onyx noticed and pointed out some archers hiding in the trees nearby too.
		-He said he'd been waiting for us, and said, as an honorable man, we'd be unharmed if we
		 turned the one known as Pip over to him.
		-Libak did his best to talk our way out of this, but was quickly interrupted by the monk,
		 who said we were clearly enscrolled, as he fell into a martial arts stance.
		-With that, battle was joined, with Onyx rushing forward to attack the monk and Libak shortly
		 behind.
		-I, meanwhile, began to follow the monk's example, powering up myself with Invulnerable Skin
		 of Bronze, soon followed by Essence Fangs and Scales as I strode forward slowly.
			-Mumbling, "The dragon is slow to rouse, slow to anger. . ."
		-His power up seems to have resulted in sinuous, flame-like movements.
		-Golden Blade threw a damned tree at the archers, addressing that problem, but was then
		 attacked by previously unseen ninjas, blue robed and throwing chakram at him.
		-I then rushed forward, interposing myself between the monk and my two companions battling him,
		 trying to strike him but only managing a glancing blow against his armor.
			-Now shouting, "But the dragon's wrath is terrible to behold! Face me instead!"
		-The ninjas impaled various points on Blade's body with thrown weapons, nearly paralyzing him
		 (they seem to be poisoned) but he nonetheless managed to scare them off with his aura (a
		 property, I think, of the Dawn Caste).
		-The rest of the circle and I, though, struggled to land blows on the monk.
		-After several nicks, I (with the help of Willpower and Valor) managed to land a solid blow
		 on the monk, from which he staggered back several feet.
		-At that, he turned and fled too, but Silent Onyx took off after him.
		-The rest of us attempted to pursue the fleeing ninjas, but they used some form of kata to
		 disappear.
			-We may still be able to track them, but first need to deal with Blade, who's slowly
			 regaining feeling in his extremities, and Pip, who's having a bit of an existential
			 crisis after giving it her all but being still unable to land an arrow on the monk.
			-By the time we pulled ourselves together, Silent Onyx had returned, carrying the pair of
			 red jade gladiuses and the matching breastplate.
			-We did indeed then began tracking the ninjas, following Libak's lead.
			-Libak was able to lead us along their trail, back to a camouflaged tent suspended between
			 three high trees.
			-Still intent on a peaceful resolution, Libak tried to parlay with them.
			-They (predictably) used the opportunity to ambush us (and Lesley used the opportunity to
			 play with mass combat).
			-We made a mess of them.
			-Afterwards, we went through their stuff, looking for notes or information.
				-We indeed found information, confirming that the Immaculate Monks had been tipped off
				 by a guard, in turn contacted by a sailor, about the anathema named Pip.
					-Cessus Naruka was the fire monk's name.
				-We also found an impossibly balanced knife, perhaps some form of artifact.
		-We then moved on from East from there, deeper into the mountains.
			-With Libak's new found recollections of past-life survivalism, we were able to brave
			 frigid temperatures and avoid a large colony of bears.
			-The path was often precarious, narrow paths along the side of mountains and the like.
				-Apparently there were also some yetis.
			-Eventually, passing through a forest we came to an area that had been strangely scoured
			 of life, what the map called "The Demon Lands". The forest stopped suddenly at it's edge,
			 and even insects were absent within it.


8/2/21: Dining with Demons
	-We began this session on the edge of The Demon Lands.
	-At the edge of this ominous place, I opted for bronze skin and claws. It seems a dangerous
	 place, likely free of _mortal_ witnesses at least.
	-After walking 20 minutes or so in, we came upon a strange structure made of lashed bones,
	 some marker. It was being clawed at by horrific beings, in between fighting among themselves.
	-Onyx and I noticed the wasp-winged creatures resembled demons we'd heard of, Agatae.
		-Normally just beautiful wasps, these seemed a horrifying cross between that and a cat.
	-We approached them and Blade attempted to disperse them with charmed threats.
	-He met apparent success, the creatures fleeing immediately.
	-Seemingly in response, though, the mist suddenly thickened, and withdrew. In it's place,
	 ten figures were there, who quickly knealt prostrate before us.
	-They greeted us as Exalted lords (claiming the scent of our essence was. . . unmistakable).
	-With Blade questioning them as to who they are, they claimed to be "The Founders", who helped
	 "Kalbax" construct this place, and who have been here the subsequent 800 years.
		-Their spokesman gave the name U'awa.
	-Asking them about the creatures, they termed them "ice eaters", also trapped here, and a result
	 of lesser races of demons mingling with the animals of the land.
	-Asking them what they wished of us, they wanted to take us to Kordal, their leader and queen.
		-I got the strong impression, both from what they said to us, in Riverspeak, and the bits of
		 Old Realm he used to mutter to himself, that they viewed us as their route out of this place
		 they're trapped in.
	-We assented, and they then asked for a bit of blood from one of us, claiming it "had been so long
	 since they'd had fresh essence here" and that it would allow them to power their charms and speed
	 us along the way.
		-Pip, reckless as ever, was the only one willing, though I thought (through occult lore) that
		 this was neither an unprecedented request and that demons were unlikely to require
		 sympathetic magic.
	-Given the blood, they caused the ice beneath our feet to suddenly move, whisking us along, some
	 25 miles, though this wasteland, to an encampment of demons, which they named Gateway.
	-The shelters were made from every imaginable material to be found in the land, ice, rock, bone,
	 and even the stiched corpses of their fellows.
	-Many, and much varied, demons looked on, many too seeminged like hybrids with various animals.
	-"Take us to your leader."
	-They did indeed lead us into the largest structure, an igloo, on which a massive demonic woman
	 sat atop a pile of skulls, Kordal.
		-The top half was a corpulant witch-woman, atop an enormous, ant-like body.
		-Beyond the skulls, there were scattered about the bones of various meals, picked clean, and
		 a number of the cat-wasp-demons, the ice eaters.
		-U'awa invited us to dine with her and, after a question as to the menu (tubers and the meat
		 of their. . . baser kin), we accepted, dining on what appeared to be salvage (damaged plates,
		 bits of mirrors, pieces of wood, etc.)
		-Though U'awa solicitously asked after our every need, and the other demons picked lightly
		 at the food, Kordal merely stared at each of us in turn.
			-U'awa said something about what she _would_ have wanted, at some point, and, questioned,
			 explained that she was "past the point of being able to speak of her own volition."
		-After the feast, business. U'awa explained that they simply wished to return home, to
		 Malfeas, but that a rune somewhere within the manse bound us to this place. They had searched
		 for it, but to no avail.
			-I asked who had subjected them to this cruel fate, and why.
			-U'awa said that they were brought to this place to construct the manse, but, during the
			 rebellion of the Terrestrials against the Solars, their masters fell, one by one. They
			 begged for release, but were denied, until none still lived to grant it.
		-Golden Blade also broke out some booze, and the reaction was like he'd broken it out at an
		 AA meeting, as the fiends fiended for it.
			-Blade poured each a glass, which they all licked clean with grotesque thirst.
	-We assented to their request, freedom in exchange for their help reaching the manse.
	-Through his charm again, U'awa guided us to the manse at speed, stopping on a scree covered
	 field.
		-I asked U'awa now what he wanted done with the rune. Saying he did not know how the magic
		 worked, he asked that we destroy it in any way that we could.
		-A narrow, winding path, strewn with rubble, led to the hidden fortress, on a high shelf
		 above us.
		-Following the path up, we reached a door with a bronze mask embedded in it, that opened
		 at our approach, the mask splitting as the door opened.
		-Entering, we saw statues of 12 guardian beasts, and a gold masked man, seemingly made of
		 light, appeared, and spoke, in Old Realm, saying, "I Am is online."
		-Blade attempted to speak with it, receieving more Old Realm in response, which I could
		 understand as a request to keep speaking, as it was "calibrating new speech patterns".
		-I spent some time conveying that to my companions, in Riverspeak, only to hear it report
		 the completion of calibration, and begin speaking in Riverspeak, greeting us as masters
		 and welcoming us to The Invisible Fortress.
		-Blade asked it where the bodies of it's former masters lay, but it professed ignorance,
		 claiming that "internal sensors had been damaged".
		-I asked it to tell us more of it's function at the manse.
			-"I am here to assist the Solars with their needs, and the waitstaff in doing the same.
			-Asked for more than that from Libak, it said that it could only say more to the
			 hearthstone bearer.
			-At which, Onyx asked where the hearthchamber lay, to which the flickering figure
			 indicated just inside, naming it "The Grand Salon".
		-We followed his instructions into a great, two story chamber, bedecked in marble and
		 painted with light.
			-Some damage was in evidence to a corner of the ceiling above.
			-Panels depicted murals of The Unconquered Sun.
				-Libak also noticed that they depicted The Unconquered Sun with various features,
				 male and female both, in the various murals. He got the sense they'd depicted The
				 Unconquered Sun with _their_ features, rank heresy and arrogance.
			-The hearthstone, though, was not in evidence.
		-I Am spoke up, mentioning that he detected a storm brewing, one which would make it unsafe
		 to travel outside the manse. . .
		-We asked I Am where the stone was to be found, but he claimed his sensors could not detect
		 it, and that he suspected it was not within the manse.
			-The last person attuned to the hearthstone, he said, was Osandus Pol (the person
			 mentioned in the letters we've heard of), but he did not know where he or the heathstone
			 had gone.
			-Blade asked when last they were seen, but I Am claimed it would be some tie to access
			 records that long, approximately 3 days.
				-Well, he did say there was a storm coming anyways. . .
		-Golden Blade also had I Am list the rooms of the manse for us.
			East -> Parlor
			West -> Dining Room
			North -> Garden 
			South and East -> Parlor 
			South and East and South -> Trophy Room
			South and West -> Loom
			South West and South -> Library, Smithy
		-Blade was hungry, and eager to head to the dining room. Though I was thrilled by the
		 prospect of the library, I agreed that food may be a more urgent concern, if we're about
		 to be snowed in, and we headed there.
			-Within, there was a very creepy figure, a stick figure of bronze rods, draped in ancient
			 tattered robes, wearing a porcelain mask.
			-The mask reminded me of something, the ones from my vision (see top of character bio).
				-Is a soul bound within this one too?
			-No food, though, was in evidence, unless it lay within the locked, stone-doored pantry
			 on one wall, the door of which Blade was unable to force.
		-From there, we walked through the parlor, to the trophy room.
			-Cases of various knickknacks, momentos of past adventures, lined the walls.
			-None looked to be of particular value, though one case had been torn from the wall and
			 smashed.
		-We walked from there into the nearby music room.
			-More intact than most of the manse, a porcelain mask began to speak as we passed the case
			 of instruments, asking if we wished to play one of the instruments within.
			-It could tell us of little else, but when asked about the smashed case, said it contained
			 a demon-skin instruments, destroyed by the demons who had constructed the manse, after
			 the Solars were gone.
			-For more, it suggested we talk with the music master.
				-Asked where they were, it said she was likely in her room, adjoining this one.
				-We indeed went there, and found a once sumptuous bedroom, since stripped of all
				 metal and wood.
				-Lying in a pile of ashes was another porcelain mask.
				-Nudging it with my foot, I tried addressing it, to no effect.
				-Picking it up, however, I found myself again briefly awash in memory. I was quite
				 sure that, fed the tiniest amount of essence, the mask would awake.
				-I did so, and the mask rose into the air, as an elderly woman appeared wearing it.
				-She thanked us for awakening her, and remarked that she did not recognize any of us, 
				 though she _did_ seem to know us as Solars, like the rest of this place.
					-Her name is Liwet Ohazia.
				-I told her we had hoped she could help us in turn, telling us more of the manse and
				 it's functions.
					-She said she could tell us little about the manse, but could speak of those who
					 constructed it.
					-I accepted, and she led us up to an upstairs parlor, bedecked with twelve
					 portraits of the manse's lords.
					-Master Kalbax ("Bax"), of the Twilight caste, constructed this fortress.
					-Ozandus Pal, also of Twilight, was Bax's apprentice, and it was with his
					 ingenuity the manse was completed in time to retreat from the troubles in the
					 South.
					-Crinis Proles, also of Twilight, was the one who painted these portraits, and
					 many of the other works in the manse.
					-The next portrait felt like looking in a mirror. She said it was Larquen Quen,
					 of Twilight, and the creator of these masks.
						-Clearly, before me stands a portrait of one of my predecessors, The Last
						 Light's Dragon.
						-He created the spell to preserve the spirits of his greatest servants,
						 forever.
						-The man stands in a circle, surrounded by prostrate elementals, matching
						 my vision.
					-Avika _____, of the Zenith caste, helped Larquen summon the demons that created
					 the fortress. She is depicted playing a flute.
					-Meherrin, of the Zenith caste, was depicted riding bareback through The Wyld, a
					 horn at his lips, flaming spear at his side.
						-Libak seemed to start at this one.
					-Kotor Velos, of the Night caste, depicted as a contortionist, was the first to
					 see the coming trouble, warning Bax.
						-He was described as being in a "Voldo-like" position.
					-Daveg Cholurian, of the Night caste and depicted as a smith, constructed the
					 automatons that server here.
					-Vaznia, of the Night caste, was the one who scouted Malfeas for the demons that
					 constructed the manse.
					-Aeo Orcas, of the Eclipse caste, bound the Solars here in oaths of fealty, that
					 allowed them to exist here in peace, for a time.
					-Itraxian ____, of the Eclipse caste, developed a method that let one weave stone
					 like silk.
					-Surin of Justice, of the Eclipse caste, was spoken ill of by the others, but
					 did what he could to earn his place here.
				-Finishing her tale, she asked if that was all we needed, as she would return to her
				 room, and we assented.
		-We then, searching out the smithy, found instead the loom and spinning room.
			-Strange mechanical equipment was everywhere, largely broken, but it seemed to indeed
			 match the music master's description of a woman who could spin rock like wool, as such
			 was indeed underway, in the service of a half-finished tapestry.
			-A stone desk in one corner held shattered, but painstakingly reassembled clay tablets
			 bore writing.
				-Even though I speak Old Realm, the writing was hard to decipher, but, with some
				 effort, I was able to translate the dialect and determine that they were detailed
				 instructions as to the operation of the machinery, and laments that none would know
				 the operation of it after she was gone, motivating the recording of it.
				-TODO: I should read this to the folks back at my manse, copying it into my own
				 library, via the use of my wooden face.
		-We then found the ransacked smithy, and a pottery and glass blowing studio above.
			-The glass studio had traces of some strange, sharp crystal, as well as glass.
			-From the windows upstairs, we could confirm I Am's weather prediction. Outside was clearly
			 a blizzard.
		-From there, we opted to awaken the figure in the dining room, in the same fashion as the
		 music master.
			-It indeed awakened, and bowed. I asked it its name, but gesturing to its mouth, it
			 indicated it could not speak.
			-I asked if it could help us procure some food. In response, it wandered over to the stone
			 pantry, rapped on it, and opened it revealing jars of mostly dust, some still good honey,
			 and some rock hard bread it banged down onto the table.
			-That was disappointing, but Blade was undeterred, pulling out the cookpot he won in a
			 contest with a god.
				-Tossing the bread and a bit of honey into the pot yielded a delicious stew, and thus
				 it would seem we have access to at least _some_ food.
		-The nearby baths were in rough shape, but boiling water poured from a corroded fixture,
		 apparently from the essence fueled boiler nearby, adjoining both baths and smithy.
		-North of there, we found the library, to my great excitement.
			-The stones shelves were sadly largely empty, with only a few metal sheets remaining in
			 a jumble, seemingly a result of the demons' frantic search for the rune. Fragments of
			 the covers of other tomes lay scatterd on the ground.
			-One of the most intact remaining books, printed on sheets of gold, was missing the back
			 half of its pages, but appeared to be a manual of sorcery by Larquen Quen.
				-This I definitely grabbed, and stuck it in my bag, to be perused after we've explored
				 the rest of the manse.
					-TODO: read that, and give it the wooden face archiving too.
		-West of there lay the conjuring room.
			-It featured three summoning circles, inlaid in the floor with Orichalcum. One for demons,
			 one for elementals, and one unlike anything I'd ever heard, but which yet felt familiar.
			-Hopefully the tome sheds some light on the subject.
		-The next room we found contained the _false_ garden.
			-Decorated with silk flowers and foliage, the worksmanship was supurb, creating a convincing
			 illusion of being outside.
			-The walls were painted with life-like frescos of tranquil garden scenes, making the room
			 feel much bigger than it is.
			-We could feel the two frescos on either side tugging at our essence like artifacts.
				-Libak spent a mote, and was able to _step into the painting_, into a tranquil garden
				 like what's depicted, though one that felt like it extended no further than the size
				 of the false garden.
				-A nice amenity.
		-We took a staircase up from there, leading to a room with a strange labyrinth.
			-It was constructed of random debris from around the mansion, somehow hardened into place
			 and now possessed of stone-like resiliency. From this were formed winding tunnels,
			 through which one would be forced to crawl.
				-Perhaps what the scavenging below was about, instead of or as as well as the
				 construction of Gateway.
				-Come to think of it, is this strange construction the work of the demons? They were
				 brought here for _construction_, after all. . .
			-We broke out some of the rope we'd gotten in our kits for this trip, and Libak ventured
			 into the strange maze.
				-The thing was fiendishly constructed. He doubted that, without Solar-charm-enhanced
				 snese, he would have been able to make it to the heart of it.
				-He later shouted out, as if injured, and, in response to my queries, he claimed to
				 have seen Kotor Velos in here, who stabbed him.
				-Blade and I took up guard positions at either side of the maze's entrance, to deal
				 with anything that fled it, but we doubted two could fight in those tunnels and did
				 not follow Libak in.
				-Later, though, I could hear scuttling, on the otherside of the junk wall from me.
				-Improvising a quick plan, I had Blade swing the bronze me at the wall with all his
				 might.
				-That sufficed to bash through the wall, into the backstage of the maze, with a
				 figure quickly fleeing deeper, into the adjacent room.
				-I ran after it, leaping at it's back to attack as I entered the room.
				-The blow glanced off armor, but off _Libak's_ armor. The figure was suddenly nowhere
				 to be seen.
				-Is it an illusion? Libak claims it stabbed him, with a weapon he showed me.
				-Deeper into the maze's backstage, we came upon a horror scene.
					-More than 30 mummified corpses were in one corner of the room, all but one
					 hanging from spikes on the wall.
						-They seemed to be Northerners of various ages, but all apparently dead at
						 least 50 years.
					-The one on the floor was clearly Kotor Velos, seemingly long dead and mummy-dry
				-Another door from this backstage area led to an antechamber, with further doors
				 going South.
					-We left off there for the session, intending to collect the others and then
					 continue exploring.


8/16/21:
	-Libak and I followed our rope back through the backstage of the maze, to collect the others.
	-We relayed to them the events with the ghost/spirit/whatever, and the grisly tableau we'd
	 found.
		-We knew so-called "hungry ghosts" often rose from the unburied dead, remaining until they
		 fulfilled some purpose, but we were unsure if Libak's sacred flames consuming the corpses
		 had fully addressed the problem or not.
	-We then opted to return along our marked path through the maze, to further explore the second
	 floor of the manse.
	-Blade strode quickly down a hallway, ignoring smaller doors, with us trailing after him.
	 Eventually he came to a door marked by a shredded portrait, and entered.
		-Based on the workroom connected to the shredded bedroom, we surmised it was Kalbax's room.
		-The workroom featured a 16' tall model of the manse, seemingly indestructible, but
		 splattered with what we presumed to be vengeful demon filth.
		-It was also filled with the remains of documents, of which only clay tablets had survived
		 the ages.
			-They, though, depicted blueprints, for both this manse and many other buildings,
			 including even some we recognized as First Age buildings in Nexus!
				-The Nexus buildings interestingly showed extensive underground portions. . .
				-All of that sounds potentially valuable, and certainly worth salvaging, though
				 also somewhat weighty, and in need of careful packing.
	-An adjoining bedroom appeared to belong to Kalbax's student, Pal.
		-In a drawer guarded by a tiny mask, disarmed by Silent Onyx's Charms, we found some letters
		 signed with his mark, to Mithra.
			-letters_to_mithra.pdf
			-We recognized the mark, as he was the author of the letters our captive Abyssal had
			 reproduced for us. Here were more letters to his lover.
	-We found several more bedrooms, though containing little of interest.
	-An office, though, featured a locked, and soon defeated, chest.
		-Inside lay two artifacts, both tied to darkness.
		-One, a band of leather which I recognized as demon skin, showed an indent, as if for the
		 nose. Golden Blade was reluctant to touch it, but I boldly tied it over my eyes.
			-It proved to be a "Shadowlight Caul", inverting darkness and light for the purposes of
			 vision.
			-It seemed of great use to Silent Onyx, who I offered it up to.
		-The other was an amulet, of onyx, orichalcum, and jade. Not to be shown up _twice_, Blade
		 placed it around his neck. He was instantly wreathed in concealing shadows, and said it
		 also tugged at his Essence, as if it could be fed Essence for some effect.
			-This too we offered up to Silent Onyx, but he seemed uninterested, confident in his
			 abilities in this area.
			-As such, I volunteered to grab it, saying I wouldn't mind being able to keep up with
			 Onyx in such pursuits, though I said it seemed best to experiment with it's other
			 functions in safer circumstances.
	-A much smaller bedroom contained a mask on the remains of a bed.
		-Feeding it 5 motes of essence, I awoke what turned out to be the head servant.
		-He was very helpful, mentioning:
			-That tombs for each of the solars once residing here had been constructed, in advance
			 of their need, in the cellar. Only Kal Bax had been laid to rest when last the valet
			 was awake.
				-Ask by Blade what he may have been buried with, the valet was unsure, but speculated
				 that his white robe and rune stone (!) may still lie with him.
			-That defenses were controlled from the parlor with it's portraits of the solars, though
			 he did not know how they worked.
			-That he was in charge of the staff, and was the first bestowed with this new form, as
			 their lifespans reached their ends.
				-I asked him how he felt about that and he said, strangely, "I do not know."
				-"You do not recall?" I asked.
				 "I do not. . . feel, the way I once did, in this form. . ."
				-Not the most pleasant existance, sounds like. . .
	-From there, we decided to return to the parlor and investigate the defenses.
		-In the South of the room, glass orbs were mounted on four daises, with mirrors behind them.
		-Blade approached one, and, when he got close, the mirror changed, and revealed a scene
		 outside the fortress, snow in motion, falling.
		-I was unsure of the function of the devices, but Onyx termed them "metasorcerous
		 resonators", having apparently encountered (read: stolen) a paper related subject. Sorcery
		 and other Charms can be used _through_ such things. Often, they're paired with artifacts
		 or magitech that can summon elementals, such that a melee charm used through the orb would
		 be performed by the elemental.
	-After that, most were eager to investigate the tombs in the cellar, but I pushed instead to
	 first sweep the attic, suspecting the situation may. . . evolve rapidly once we held the rune.
	-The attic featured many large rooms, many featuring large holes in their roofs, through which
	 snow fell onto tables full of dead plants.
	-Down a hallway, though, we could see a trail of brown, long dried blood along the still-clear
	 floor.
		-Inside was a grisly tableau, blood scattered everywhere and a corpse, surrounded by
		 surgical instruments, on a table. A distance away from the table, a severed arm, _not_
		 belonging to the corpse, lay on the floor.
			-Libak looked the scene over thoroughly, eventually concluding that the corpse had been
			 experimented on, while alive, but had fought back, severing someone's arm, only to fall,
			 wounded or dead, a short distance away and be dragged back to the table.
				-Looking close, we thought it might be Crinis Proles, one of the exalts in the
				 portraits above (in fact, likely the one who painted them).
			-Meanwhile, Pip and I examined the arm, clad in a bracer.
				-The bracer was marked with writing in Old Realm, writing I could see were prayers
				 to Brigid, Mother of Sorcery.
				-They also seemed to have a socket for a hearthstone.
				-Pip put them on, and felt nothing, though pins did emerge from the heartstone
				 socket, and then retract.
				-I (still being cagey about my own manse) offered to examine it further, and see
				 what I could learn, so Pip gave it over to my care.
					-Looking them over quickly, they seemed somehow similar to the metasorcerous
					 resonators. Perhaps again something sorcery can be used _through_?
	-The rest of the attic was empty, so we headed to the basement.
		-At the base of the stairs we followed down, great glass blades had emerged from the last
		 two stairs, some dusty time ago.
			-Looks like the demons may have had a poor time here.
		-Exploring the basement, we came upon a mask hanging on the wall, clearly sylized as a cook
		 (chef's hat, Boyardee mustache, etc.).
			-Feeding it five motes of essence, the figure formed indeed offered us food.
			-Though, asked about the stores, he confessed they were bare, but inisted that, given
			 time, he could make *something*.
				-Asking him what that would be seemed to yield only a loop, so we assented, and
				 asked where we should wait, and he suggested the arena, saying our predecessors
				 often took meals there in between training.
		-The arena was a large open room, likely beneath the grand salon and similar in size save
		 height. It's walls were lined with mundane-but-sericeable examples of seemingly every
		 melee weapon known to creation.
			-Three bronze centurions stood in alcoves around the room, each surrounded by a set of
			 weaponry. Presumably the automaton opponents offered by the training room.
		-Mere moments later, a parade of masked servants delivered dish after dish to the room,
		 piled high with foods of all sorts.
			-It looked fantastic, and felt like real food, but smelled and tasted like little to
			 nothing. It provided the feeling of fullness, but, from the letters, you suspect it
			 offerred no nourishment.
			-We spent an hour dining nonetheless, then continued through the basement.
	-The next door we checked led to a. . . servant's dormitory of a kind.
		-It's walls were coverred in racks of masks, hundreds of them, perhaps a thousand.
		-Some suggested clear roles, maid masks, cook masks, etc., but the vast majority were marked
		 with an Old Realm symbol, which Blade called me over to tranlsate.
			-It was the mark of Rabszolga, god of slaves. . .
			-This not unsuprisingly irked Golden Blade, who grabbed one, and fed essence into it.
			-A small, emaciated man appeared, to fill out the mask, and Blade asked him who he was,
			 to which he received no response.
			-Asked if he understood, the figure nodded, but did not seem able to speak.
			-Golden Blade then asked if he wished to be free of this existence, getting another nod
			 in response. Blade then immediately smashed the mask.
			-He then began babbling about how best to smash many masks.
				-"All of the masks?" I asked him.
				 "The slaves."
				-Between Libak and myself, we convinced him it was perhaps not the time, given the
				 danger we were still in, and that it could be hazerdous, messing with things only
				 half understood here. He agreed to return to the matter later.
	-Another set of doors proved to be the cooks kitchen and scullery, now dormant, and thoroughly
	 ransacked, leaving some question as to the origin of the false food.
	-On the other side of the hallway, we found our first tomb, in what seemed to be a former
	 storeroom.
		-Writing in Old Realm marked it as the tomb of Larquen Quen (!).
			-I did a lot of describing of Garn's suspicious reactions to this, though never admitted
			 to my connection to Quen. _Especially_ after some comments about him being the "monster"
			 who created these masks.
			-Though Garn was reluctant, the others plowed ahead with opening the tomb.
				-The corpse inside was missing an arm (!).
					-Yet more grisly crimes on his (my?!?) part.
				-The inside of the tomb, meanwhile, was covered in scratches, and some of them formed
				 words: "I will return" (!!!)
				-After Pip translated that, the rest of the circle hurridly closed the tomb again with
				 it's slab.
	-Itraxian the Weaver
		-This tomb was already open, and there were ropes suspended from pulleys in the ceiling,
		 seemingly used to lift the slab on top of it, such that we could simply peer in.
		-It contained _three_ bodies. One nothing but bones, one cut in half, one mummified and pinned
		 to the wall by a scythe blade, likely part of a sprung trap.
			-The bones had a orichalcum ring, set with a single jewel.
			-The trap-pinned mummy, on the other hand, bore the Mon of House Peleps, one of the
			 twelve great houses of the Dragon-blooded. Perhaps we were not the first to find the
			 manse in the last millenia. . .
	-The ring was of interest, but we thought it best to perhaps have Libak ritually incinerate the
	 corpses before we further disturbed grave goods.
		-In discussing the matter, I asked if we shouldn't retrieve Larquen's arm before doing so.
		-Seeing the opportunity for a good deed, Pip characteristically ran off, shouting that she'd
		 go fetch it.
	-Perhaps 15-20 minutes later, Silent Onyx, the most perceptive of us, claimed to hear a knocking,
	 as if at a metal door, coming from above.
		-We followed him up to the first floor, where someone was indeed banging on the door, now
		 faintly.
		-Looking from one to another, Blade went to go open the door, revealing a half-frozen Pip,
		 collapsed at the threshold of the gate, wounded.
		-None of us are overly competant when it comes to medicine, but I seemed to guess most.
			-I worried that too quick a temperature change may harm her, but remembered that bath's
			 offered a _cool_ water pool as well, and we carried her to it, immersing her within.
			-Gradually, she came to, and relayed a tale of encountering and unknown man, who fled
			 for the roof, climbing a rope through one of the holes in the attic's ceiling.
			-She had followed, but lost her footing on the snowy roof and fell, narrowly missing
			 spikes of ice below. She crawled from there to the gate, hoping to find her way back
			 inside.
	-After Pip soaked for 20 minutes, she was feeling up to _walking_ at least, and we returned to
	 the grand salon, to question I Am.
		-Libak asked if there was some form of surveillance system in the manse, to which I Am
		 replied that "a matrix of custodial dedication" existed.
			-At that, I Am flickered, and apparently rebooted, introducing himself again.
		-Libak then asked if I Am had access to the system, to which it admitted partial access, so
		 Libak asked if it had seen whatever figure had been assailing us.
			-"There are none living or operating in the manse aside from you six and myself."
		-Further questions about the limits of the system earned the response that, "Discussions of
		 weaknesses of the manse are limited to the hearthstone bearer."
			-Who, Libak asked, was last attuned to the heathstone.
			 "Ozandus Pal."
			 "When was the connection broken?"
			 "Unknown. Speculation: 700 years ago."
			-I Am also seemed to doubt the possibility of any backdoor access to the system.
				-Asked if any could have created such a thing, I Am said only those resident here
				 could have. Beyond Kal Bax, only Ozandus Pal, Cirinus Proles, Larquen Quen, and
				 Maheren would have had the skill.
				-After that, I Am again flickered and rebooted.
	-After I Am's reboot, we heard an immense thump from the Southeast, shaking the building.
		-We could hear many voices, some shouting words, other more. . . bestial.
		-Hurrying up to the parlor, we used one of the mirrors behind the daises, and saw that the 
		 demon horde had come, Kordal among them and U'awa directing them from a dias borne by
		 ape-like demons. They were battering the walls of the manse, even using trebuchets of
		 their typical salvage-built construction.
			-Among them were also wasp-winged bird hybrids (!).
				-"Beware the birds."
		-Libak was intent on figuring out what triggered this assault, and I suggested that perhaps
		 a charm of the voice could be used through one of the orbs, to communicate with them.
			-Using a Performance excellency, Libak went (unexpectedly) fully iconic, and a great
			 golden image of Libak suddenly stood before the manse, asking, "Why have you come to 
			 interrupt our investigation?"
			-Through the mirror, we could see U'awa shouting and gesturing, but heard no words. The
			 trebuchet-flung rocks that followed immediately, suggested the words may not have been
			 for our ears anyways.
			-Blade tried Judge's Ear Technique through the orb, generating a similar golden figure
			 of himself, but could hear only roaring and warcries.
			-Resorting to a different tactic, he instead attempte Mob Dispersing Rebuke through an
			 orb, causing many of the more. . . mixed breeds to flee, though The Founders, the
			 more traditional looking demons, stood fast.
			-He then _rallied_ the fleeing crossbreeds, with Fury Inciting Presence.
				-"We are not your enemies, the ones who made you and prey on you are! You have nothing
				 to lose but your chains!"
				-Some portion of them indeed attacked their kin, causing chaos, but still the
				 trebuchets struck the building.
		-I then tried my (clawed) hand at one of the orbs, falling into a martial arts form, and
		 stepping towards the orb. I reached out to it and, touching it, imagined reaching _through_
		 it, striking out at one of the trebuchets in the "mirror", using my Armor-Penetrating Fangs
		 Strike.
			-A golden avatar of myself indeed appeared, striking the trebuchet with a fist wreathed
			 in in twining golden dragons, smashing both the trebuchet and the crew surrounding it
			 with an immense fist.
		-Libak then suddenly shouted, saying he knew where the tomb was, running off down the hall
		 toward Bax's chambers.
			-"It's under the model!"
			-Blade and I both ran after him, I shouting cautions: "By all the gods, whatever you do,
			 I _don't_ think we should be unleashing these demons on Creation!"
			-At the model, he stopped to examine it, and I, warning Libak one more time that we
			 probably should not give the demons what they want, then shouted to Blade: "Come! Let
			 us finish those trebuchets!"
		-Back at the orbs, Blade took his own swing(s) at the trebuchets, smashing the remaining
		 three trebuchets.
		-By that time, Libak had returned, bearing a golden book and _a rune inscribed stone tablet!_
			-He rushed over, asking if for someone who could read Old Realm, and I stepped forward
			 to take the tablet and book.
			-The book's cover read, "Manse Construction, by Kalbax".
			-The tablet's runes, meanwhile, read "Binding", "Command", and "Obedience".
				-I fed it essence until it drank no more, 20 essence in total, and then seemed to
				 radiate an aura of authority
					-Are those motes _committed_? If merely spent, I how long does the effect
					 last? The circle seemed to notice the aura of authority.
					-Talked with Lesley.
						-To turn it on, you go iconic and it consumes all of one of your essence
						 pools, typically personal.
						-When attuned, for 1 mote, and you talk to a demon of Kordal's brood, it
						 counts as unnatural mental influence and they must spend your essence in
						 willpower to ignore your order.
						-While holding it, you also get the benefits of Enemy Castigating Solar Judgement 
							-You deal aggravated damage towards the brood, and also have some social
							 combat benefits.
			-I suspected we now had in hand what we needed to address the demons.
			-I instructed the circle to follow me downstairs, to the gate of the manse, and then
			 walked down the stairs.
			-Only at the gate did I turn around, to see that all of the circle had indeed followed,
			 and told them to on their guard.
			-With that, I drew a breath, and then pushed open the doors of the manse.
			-At the sight of me, the demons fell to their knees (or whatever they might have to
			 bend) in an expanding wave.
			-"What is this treachery that brings howling you to the gates of the manse, in violation
			 of our deal?"
			-It was U'awa who replied, shouting that they didn't trust us to honor the deal, and
			 that they had come to destroy the rune.
			-"It is you who violated the deal! We stand absolved of the bargain!"
				-Conveniently what Garn wanted.
			-"Turn your backs to the manse, and stand guard! Raise the hue and cry if any save our
			 circle and your host are seen!"
			-At that, Kordal finally found her voice, releaseing a terrible, insectoid screech, but
			 even her great bulk seemed unable to resist and, though she struggled, she turned.
			-At that, I slammed the doors and, turning, leaned back against them and let out a,
			 "Whew!"
				-When I did, just momementarily, I saw the old Solars who first resided here, worn
				 and out of breath themselves, presumably during their own retreat into the manse,
				 before it faded back to my own circle.
	-With the demons addressed for the moment, we went to check out this preserved room Libak spoke
	 of.
		-It lay through a door behind the now-shifted model, and seemed to be Bax's true bedchamber.
		-It also looked to be unsacked, with many books and scrolls still lining the walls.
		-A search of them revealed most or all to be manse blueprints, some of which we recognized.
			-They described manses located in Nexus, Lookshy, being used as government buildings in
			 various parts of The Riverlands, and _The Imperial War Manse, The Sword of Creation,
			 the fucking Imperial Manse with which The Empress seized The Realm!_
				-The ones for that last are partial, from an _upgrade_, not it's constuction, but
				 include what are supposedly detailed maps of it's interior!
				-Well holy fuck. Who wants to rule Creation?
			-The rooms windows were bricked up, and perhaps the model can even be shifted back,
			 concealing it for as many more centuries as we might require, making it perhaps the
			 manse's most defensible room. We can barricade it and rest inside.
				-Garn did some reading of that golden book during that rest.
					-It heavily discusses manse construction.
					-It also includes two spells, a Celestial one and a Solar one:
						-The Celestial spell is Raise the Puissant Sanctum (White Treatise pg. 79).
						-The Solar spell works in the same way, but works instaneously, and costs
						 20 more motes.
					-In addition, it adds +5 auto successes to design rolls when constructing manses
					 and allows for construction of manses with UNLIMITED manse creation points.
				-You also had some time, during your guard shift, to play with new artifacts.
					-Socketing your manse's hearthstone into the bracer with the prayer to Brigid 
					 and attuning to it, you became aware of it's nature and powers.
						-It is a Metasorcerous Phylactery. See Roll20.
					-The amulet, then, proved to hold two more powers when fed essence.
						-It is an Amulet of Shadow (rank 5 version, with all the powers). See Roll20.
						-It's use fits your anima, as you alternate between hidden and shining.
						-Holy shit; it allows you to interact with the incorpreal in Shadow Form!


8/30/21:
	-In the run up to the session, Libak asked me what I knew of Meherrin, and I shared what I'd
	 read in this place.
		-He admitted to holding some of Meherrin's memories, and when I asked, said he did indeed
		 suspect Meherrin was his past incarnation.
	-We probably need to secure some food, as I, at least, could spend a century digesting this place.
		-Eating demons is probably an option, but poses. . . ethical questions.
		-The conjured food won't help us long term as, even with the cook pot, it offers no real
		 sustenance.
		-The masked servant in the dining room _was_ able to get a rock-hard chunk of black bread
		 from the otherwise unopenable cabinet there, which the cookpot _could_ render edible.
		-Stealthy supply runs may also be an option, once the blizzard dies down.
	-We also discussed the subject of the tombs, and opted to seek them out again first.
		-Libak now has the motes to put the occupants (more thoroughly) to rest.
		-Pip was very intent on this, and, in so doing, kept speaking of "my" ring, in Itraxian's
		 tomb.
			-I questioned her and she did indeed believe Itraxian to have been her own past
			 incarnation.
		-We headed first back to Itraxian's again, to retrieve the ring.
			-OOC, something I wasn't clearly aware of last time, the tomb is 30 ft. deep, posing
			 something of a challenge.
			-Rishi sent us off well equiped with rope, though, and, tying some to the rigging that
			 had been used to lift the slab, Libak climbed down (he being the Zenith who could
			 incinerate the corpses with sacred fire).
			-Libak did his caste's thing, and retrieved the ring, climbing back up.
				-He did report some strange gas or the like, bending his perceptions at the bottom,
				 perhaps another trap.
			-The ring possessed strange properties, including an arm that always pointed to our
			 Southwest (from the room we're in, anyways).
			-Libak handed it to Pip, who recalled that it was her _personal_ Resplendent Personal
			 Assitant (see Roll20, but this one requires no mote committed).
			-Pip then froze for a moment, only to shout "Cease!" at me, when she came to.
			-Questioning her, she said she witnessed my past incarnation's work on the table above,
			 at which I did have to admit I was Quen come again.
		-We then went through the door from Itraxian's tomb that we'd not yet explored, to find yet
		 another tomb.
			-This one belonged to Vaznia, of the Night Caste.
			-Silent Onyx spent a long time staring at the inscriptions on the walls. . .
			-Turning a way from them, though, he quickly set to work on the tomb.
				-Tomb raiding seemed to be a matter he was quite experienced with.
				-He carefully disabled several traps, removing needles, fragile jars of who knows
				 what, and under-tension razor wire.
				-It too was 30' deep, the bottom smothered in shadows.
				-He had our newly found Caul, though, and, blindfolding himself, could see the
				 bottom.
				-Within, a skeleton lay in a pile a junk, the bottom 6' or so covered in scratches.
					-The skeleton's finger bones seemed correspondingly worn down. . .
			-Libak again volunteered to descend into the tomb, to incinerate the corpse, and did so
			 without incident.
			-Searching through the junk down there, Libak found a strange mirror, wrapped in cloth.
				-The mirror had something smeared over it, blacking it out entirely, and the cloth
				 had writing in Old Realm, done in the same brown material as blocked the mirror.
				-Retuning to the top, he showed it to me and, ugh, I reported that it said, "It's
				 watching me, through the mirror."
				-Onyx having admitted a connection to Vaznia, I asked him to take a look, but no
				 recollection sprung to mind.
		-From there, we continued to sweep the as of yet unexplored portions of the basement.
			-We first came to a pantry, and, with a stroke of luck, 16 jars remained intact.
			-Opening one of them, I found a number of biscuits, though the one I touched quickly
			 crumbled.
			-Pouring a jar into the cookpot gave us at least _some_ sustenance for the morning,
			 though.
				-Seems like each jar could sustain the lot of us for a day.
		-Off the pantry, a metal door led to a room that was extremely cold, it's walls comprised
		 of blocks of blue ice.
			-Inside, a large, headless ape corpse was chained, though it's size and the huge bone
			 spike jutting from it's shoulders suggest it was no _normal_ ape.
		-Off the kitchen, we found another tomb, in what seemed to have once been a wine cellar.
			-It was the tomb of Kotor Velos, as indicated by numerous images of him lining the walls.
			-We set Onyx to work on the tomb, and he soon had it open, with no traps in evidence
			 this time.
			-The interior of the tomb, this time, was collapsed, the walls caved in and the shaft
			 filled with debris.
			-Not willing to leave a stone unturned if treasures may lie beneath, Onyx climbed down
			 and began digging through the rubble.
			-Sure enough, nearly four feet into the rubble, he found a black jade egg.
			-Bringing it back up, he showed it to me, and I named it a "Cache Egg", somehow able to
			 take objects elsewhere, though I was unsure of it's operation.
			-Libak knew it's operation and, instructing Onyx in how to work it, Onyx spent a mote
			 and touched it, revealing a pair of silver and white jade axes, each with _three_
			 hearthstone sockets.
				-It's appearence suggested, in fact, a _level 4_ cache egg, able to hold up to 10
				 cubic yards. It also has the ability to be banished Elsewhere, concealing the egg.
				-See Roll20 for full details.
				-This vastly improves our ability to make stealthy supply runs from here.
		-Continuing to the East side of the basement, we found a room marked as the tomb of Kal Bax.
			-We already found his body above, though.
			-I warned against a likely trap, and Onyx set to work.
			-The tomb was indeed trapped and vacant, but also had seemingly fresher stonework at the
			 bottom, forming the clear shape of a door in the wall.
			-Onyx descended into the tomb, dodging a second trap in the process.
			-Reaching the bottom, though, we heard a loud click and, below us, could see Onyx
			 profusely sweating blood from his every pore.
			-He slowly dragged himself back up the rope, asking if any of us were doctors, to which
			 we all kind of shrugged.
				-Golden Blade unhelpfully offered him a bottle of whiskey.
			-Libak bravely volunteered, without a second's hesitation, to take a look down there
			 next.
				-Well. . . on second thought, he's still troubled by a stab wound. Perhaps it would
				 be best to rest a bit before again trying our luck again here.
	-We grabbed a couple of jars of biscuits, and headed back up to Kal Bax's secret room to rest.
		-Onyx and I both made a concerted effort to investigate the mechanism for closing and hiding
		 the rooms door again. I had no real idea, but Onyx noticed an odd object that, moved on the
		 shelf, revealed a control panel that allowed him to seal and hide the room again.
		-While the others rested, Blade and I headed over to the dining room, to investigate the
		 bread we'd been able to get there previousl.
			-Activating the servant there and experimenting, it was willing to bring each of us that
			 asked a loaf of bread three times a day.
			-Over the next several days, we were able to retrieve some 6 days worth of loaves for
			 us, though they eventually ran out.
		-We also spent a lot of time debating options for leaving this place, with the blizzard
		 being our biggest barrier.
			-As such, we opted to ask I Am about the weather, and maybe even weather control, but
			 with no real luck.
	-In three days, Libak, at least, would be healed, and also able to learn a charm that would aid
	 him in investigating the tomb, so we sealed ourselves in Bax's room.
		-I set about dictating what I could, via my Wooden Face.
			-I did Quen's manual of sorcery and the tablet with instructions for the rock weaving
			 process, at least.
		-On the second day, we heard the sounds of battle coming from outside the manse.
		-Rushing to the defense stations, we could see a great battle taking place outside, between
		 the demons and The Wyld Hunt.
			-The battle was short and bloody, ultimately won by the demons, who played with and
			 gradually ate the survivors.
			-The demons took heavy losses themselves, though.
			-As it ended, we heard the doors beneath us open, and then slam shut.
		-Heading down to the vestibule, we found a trail of blood leading from the door, off through
		 the dining room.
			-Following it, we could hear a woman sobbing in the library.
			-Entering it, we could see her, critcally wounded by grevious claw marks, leaning against
			 a shelf.
				-"Kill me if you want, anathema!"
				-As we discussed her fate, she mentioned something about the storm extending all the
				 way to Wangler's Knob, which doesn't sound good for us.
				-It finally dawned on us, much to Onyx's frustration, that perhaps some of the
				 servants knew something of medicine.
					-I rushed off with Pip to the head servant's room, asking him if any of the
					 servants were knowledgeable about medicine.
					-He knodded, and led us down to the room full of masks, pulling down three of
					 them. I thanked him and rushed back to the library.
					-Asking if anyone had motes to spare, Libak volunteered to feed 5 motes into
					 each of the masks.
					-That yielded the forms of 3 women, with white smocks and leather gloves, who
					 immediately set to work on the woman, pulling tools from ghostly bags and
					 performing a field surgery sans anethesia.
					-They removed the woman's. . . strange cloak, formed of two bolts of black cloth
					 and bits of black metal we recognized as soulsteel, a thing we associated with
					 _deathknights_.
					-She also had a disk of orichalcum, two boxes that crackled strangely when
					 touched, and an orichalcum chakra.
						-Some rations as well, helpfully.
					-Eventually, she seemed stable, and barely conscious.
						-The servants then set to work on Onyx.
				-She seemed shocked we'd let her live.
					-She said that her life was a debt she could not easily repay, but did say she
					 wished to offer _something_.
					-As such, she told us of the artifacts she carried (Roll20 has them):
						-The wings had a fivefold harmonic adapter attached, allowing her, and perhaps
						 us, to use it as a deathknight would. They allowed the wearer to fly, and
						 could also be used as daiklaives.
							-The adapter itself is backed with soulsteel, limiting it's use to
							 soulsteel artifacts.
							-See Wings of the Raptor in Roll20.
						-The buzzing boxes were Lightning boxes.
						-The chakram then, was a "Sun's Fist Chakram", and was part of how they
						 disrupted the storm.
					-She also gave her name as Catala Gaman (in the Imperial style, Catala is the
					 name of her House).
				-We stepped out of the room, to discuss her fate, leaving Pip to guard her.
					-I was intent on what we could learn from her, Libak on mercy, and both Blade
					 and Onyx on her death.
				-We suddenly heard a shout from Pip, yelling, "What the fuck was that?"
					-Rushing into library, we saw Pip standing over the woman with her Rak staff,
					 while she shouted, "I did not cast it!"
					-Libak and Blade had already used their Judge's Ear Technique, and she did not
					 seem to be lying.
					-She claimed her cousin had cast a spell, the Infallible Messenger, attempting
					 to find her, though it allowed no response.
						-Again, no lies.
					-Blade began to generally behave like a psycho, demanding that she agree to kill
					 her family for some reason, a thing she said she did not _wish_ to do, insisting
					 that he must kill her as a result.
					-He drew his blade, while I moved to parry it and Libak and Pip sought to talk
					 him down.
					-They did seem to meet with some success, at least buying some time to craft an
					 oath, without me having to catch blade with claw.
	-We left off there, with a week of downtime, time for Pip and Libak to create their oath, Silent
	 Onyx to heal, and perhaps some amount of advancement.


TODO:
	-Spend XP? 29 left after getting the repair spell.
		-That week of downtime is enough for a spell.
			-The repair spell?
				-Committing to it! XP spent, and Lesley will be giving you the rest of the book.
		-Or Occult charms? The charms and abilities both could be instant.
			-Spirit-Detecting Glance is great now that you have an artifact that would let you
			 attack them without another charm. It's a mere 8 XP.
			-Still possible with the spell.
			-13 more would then even get you Occult 4 and Ghost-Eating Technique. . .
		-Only need to save 24 XP to go up in Essence when next you have 3 months.
			-Not direly urgent, though.
			-Maybe get Spirit-Detecting Glance, counting on the fact that you'll get at _least_ 3
			 more XP before your next batch of downtime?
				-Lets confirm the details of that Amulet of Shadow Walking and then do it.
				-Ah, it lets you see them anyways!
	-Suspend spells?
		-The trigger function of the Metasorcerous Phylactery allows this.
		-Do the hearthstone dots regenerate _even if the spell has not yet triggered_? If so, this
		 is _crazy good for you.
			-Lesley ruled that they do indeed! Asked about it here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/882015425800585307
			-Also confirmed spell cost motes regenerate: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/882375725099937824
	-Description of how you spend that week: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/882383781439348756
		.   Well, then, for the rest of the circle, Garn spends most of the week we're barricading ourselves in Bax's room sitting on the floor, legs crossed and eyes closed, apparently meditating.
		.   At the beginning of the week, though, he pulls up his long sleeves, undoes the strips of white cloth wrapping something on his forearms, revealing them to be a pair of shining Orichalcum bracers. Slowly, he removes them both, and, from one of them, removes a lustrous orange gem stone (a hearthstone, to those who'd recognize it). He takes it, and inserts it into socket on another bracer, the ornate one found on the severed arm in the attic above, and places that artifact on his right arm.
		.   He then immediately sets about casting three spells, to no apparent effect, only to then reverse the process with the bracers, stashing the new one back in his bag, and then going back to maybe-meditating on the floor.
		.   Towards the end of the week, he again springs into strange action, this time pulling a damaged book from his backpack. It's one from the library in the manse, missing the back half of it's golden pages. He begins a casting ritual over it, though, and, a minute later, it's been restored to seemingly pristine condition, all pages intact. He then sits right back down on the floor and begins reading it, starting from the middle.
		(He doesn't offer any explanations of what he's doing, though you're more than welcome to question him!)
	-Return to the fresher stonework in Bax's tomb?
		-Has the gas or whatever dissipated?


9/13/21:
	-Golden Blade seemed to have some visions during our week of rest, mentioning that his name was
	 once "Morning Star", and that he had been betrayed by a member of his circle.
	-Libak did indeed venture forth, in search of supplies.
		-With him were a large wolf, a giant snake, and a person bisected down the middle, half
		 male and half female, dressed in raven feathers.
			-Silver Maw Bliss, the wolf, who was seeking the one known as "Morning Star", and who
			 went straight up to Blade, smelling him.
				-After smelling him, he shifted form, into a man's form.
				-Blade seemed to recognize him, in this form. It would seem Silver Maw Bliss was
				 acquainted with his last incarnation.
					-Blade remarked that he'd been reborn too, only for Silver Maw to claim he'd
					 never died.
			-Blood Stained Wind was the serpent, who eventually shifted form into a woman.
			-The last was introduced as Two-Faced Raven, who was once known as Raven Singer, until
			 a Solar named Contentious Blade killed her.
				-Blade also seemed to know her from his visions, saying he, "pitied her."
		-Blade asked the trio how they shifted forms thusly, and they claimed to be the chosen of
		 Luna.
		-They also brought with them two deer they'd caught and killed, easing our supply concerns
		 somewhat.
	-We eventually headed upstairs, and, in debating that, mentioned something about our dragonborn
	 prisoner.
		-Silver Maw seemed alarmed that we had one of them here, but Blood Stained Wind approved,
		 apparently on the same page as me, saying she could be a valuable source of information.
	-After walking upstairs, the lunars spent some time examining the paintings in the parlor, while
	 Libak, Blade, and I stepped aside to discuss how we should continue.
		-Mostly, I was unsure if we should make introductions amongst the other Exalt-types without
		 settling the matter of the oath.
			-Ultimately, we decided the oath must first go forward.
		-The subject of Larquen Quen also came up, with Blade asking if anyone knew who this was,
		 he being that one that had betrayed his past incarnation. . .
			-Blade had apparently missed Libak and my exchange on this subject before, so I was
			 rather cagey and did not admit to being him reborn.
			-Blade spoke at some length of the undying magnitude of Quen's sin, though some oblique
			 cajoling on my part got him to admit that the combination of his and Quen's death both
			 may have settled the matter.
			-In the course of this, Pip also disclosed some knowledge of Quen, and a commitment to
			 _not_ murdering him (a nice change!).
	-With our plan settled, we left the lunars in the parlor, to go administer the oath.
		-Gaman assented to the oath.
	-With that done, Libak disclosed the news of our new shapeshifting visitors.
		-Gaman's face showed alarm at the mention of the lunars, but she held her tongue.
	-Returning to the parlor, Two-Faced Raven was staring at the image of Meherrin, while Blood
	 Stained Wind pointedly looked everywhere _but_ the portrait of Quen.
		-I preformed the introductions, and we set about dicussing our next course of action.
		-In the course of this, Libak mentioned that the storm was now gone. Two-Faced Raven had
		 apparently dispelled it, suggesting a sorcerous origin for it.
			-That certainly increases our options.
		-We also discussed the business that brought the lunars here.
			-Silver Maw's was already fairly clear, and indeed he'd come seeking out "his" Morning
			 Star.
				-The discussion veered into some awkward and alarming sexual tension between the two
				 of them for a bit.
			-Two-Faced Raven also seemed to be here seeking Blade, saying, somewhat cryptically, that
			 he was "weak", for seeking the trappings of this manse, claiming that they could show
			 him he had no need for such things.
			-Blood Stained Wind remained silent through this, and so I addressed her directly, asking
			 what brought _her_ here.
				-Me speaking to her seemed to cause her visible discomfort, but she kept glancing at
				 Silent Onyx, eventually addressing him as "her Vaznia", and complaining that he'd
				 given away her wedding gift, gesturing at the Amulet of Shadowwalking that Libak
				 currently carried.
				-Libak nervously returned the amulet to Onyx, saying something about having "just
				 borrowed it."
				-I think that gives us a strong sense of what her motivation is here, then.
		-We decided to return to our exploration of the manse, as we still sought the hearthstone.
			-Blood Stained Wind expressed some amusement at the thought of "Vaznia" robbing tombs,
			 a thing she claimed Vaznia would once have thought beneath her.
			-Two-Faced Raven said she'd remain and keep watch over "this thing", in reference to our
			 dragonborn prisoner (ally?). Silver Maw also opted to remain, after a brief exchange
			 with Golden Blade.
	-We went back to the (false) tomb of Kal Bax, to resume what we were working on when Silent Onyx
	 was injured.
		-After some hemming and hawing, Golden Blade volunteered to be our gas-canary, and we lowered
		 him into the tomb, to see if the gas that had attacked Onyx's skin had dissipated.
		-Blood Stained Wind also followed him in, after shifting into the form of a hummingbird,
		 though one that retained distinctly snake-like scales around the eyes.
		-They reported no sign of the gas below, so Silent Onyx slid down the rope to join them.
		-Carefully examining the strangely fresh stonework he'd noticed earlier, Onyx found that,
		 rather than stones, it was a grid of buttons.
		-Following traces of repeated fingerprints on _some_ of the stones, Onyx was able to press
		 the correct pattern, allowing the wall to swing inwards, revealing a passage.
		-Inside, a long hallway, supported by pillars and decorated with glazed tiles of many colors,
		 led to another doorway.
		-Taking the lead, Onyx approached the door, only to hear a click as he stepped up to it.
		-He thankfully managed to dodge what turned out to be a razor-thin wire of orichalcum, studded
		 with blue crystals to form a sawblade-like texture.
			-Perhaps a thing worth coming back to, given the valuable orichalcum.
		-More carefully now, he examined the door before proceeding, then boldly tried the knob.
		-Inside was a chamber containing nothing but another door, this time emblazoned with a golden
		 sunburst.
			-I recognized it as a common form of magical door, one the exalted often used for vaults
			 and the like where they wished to keep mortals out. Most commonly, they simply required
			 that essence be fed in to open.
			-I indeed began to feed essence into it, mote by mote.
			-Onyx, meanwhile, had his attention caught by a portion of the wall. Scraping away at it,
			 he found the "stone" to be a facade, concealing a small door, just large enough for an
			 adult to crawl through.
			-I abandoned my attempts at what I now suspected was a mere distraction, as Blade crawled
			 through the revealed door.
		-It led to a pillared chamber, featuring two levers, one at the center of six sunbursts.
			-I took a look inside myself, but neither of use could make much sense of what we saw,
			 though something about the construction of the room felt. . . off to me.
			-Blood Stained Wind confirmed my impression, suggesting that it was the pillars that
			 were wrong, missing two in the center the pattern called for.
			-Onyx found that the pillars were threaded through with fine wire, connected to the
			 sunburst door in a way suggesting the room would collapse were it opened.
			-The wires provided the crucial clue, though, as, tracing them, they carefully avoided
			 one door-sized section of wall. Searching the area carefully, Onyx found a lever hidden
			 near the base of the wall and, flipping it, indeed opened a hidden door there.
		-That led to yet another hallway, terminating in a door inside an alcove.
			-Onyx approached the door, only for the floor to again click at his step, leading to the
			 floor falling away, and him with it.
				-He was able to avoid rocks beneath or the debris falling with him, as he plunged
				 into freezing water.
				-Thankfully, he was able to climb out of the dunk shaft.
			-I came to join him in the room above after his fall and shout, while he searched
			 the room further, finding many more pit traps like the first.
			-He also carefully examined the door, finding no traps, just a lock, and so picked
			 the lock and went through.
		-I followed him into the next room after hearing a voice call out in Old Realm, saying,
		 "One of us speak the truth. The other only lies."
			-Inside, there were three faces on the walls, one smiling, one neutral, and one
			 frowning, it's mouth opening onto a stairway. As I entered, the neutral face
			 repeated the statement, and again, when Pip joined us.
			-Onyx asked aloud, "Which way to the hearthroom?"
				-The smiling face responded, "This way!" opening it's mouth to reveal another
				 stairway leading down.
			-Pip asked the other, frowning face, "Is what your brother said true?"
				-"Yes, it is."
			-I then asked the central, neutral face, "What of you? Are you involved in the game
			 or are you simply the referee, which only yielded a repeat of its message.
			-Pip then asked, of both masks leading to passages, "Do you speak The rivertongue?"
				-The both of them responded in the Rivertongue, the smiling one saying "No," and
				 the frowning one saying, "Yes!"
			-Shit, that's _both_ of them lying at one point or another.
			-After a bit more back and forth, Pip asked them if they were _both_ liars, and they
			 both responded, "No," both lying (speech in the Rivertongue now enabling the use of
			 Judge's Ear by those who have it, as they do not speak Old Realm).
			-It would seem both _can_ lie, and, thinking back, the riddle only specified that
			 one always _lied_, and that the other _does_ speak the truth, and may not be
			 _obligated_ to.
			-With that realization, we quickly determined the one frowning always lied, and was
			 thus, paradoxically, our best source of truth.
			-We were then able to get it to quickly reveal to us, through lies, that it contained
			 (what it considered, at least, to be) the correct passage, and we sent Silent Onyx
			 down it.
		-That led down to another door, opening into a chamber with five more doors.
			-One door was open, leading to a room covered in scorch marks.
				-Perhaps the triggered remains of yet another trap?
			-While Onyx was off down that passage, Blood Stained Wind spoke up: "Do you remember
			 the pact we made?"
				-We were all once members of The Black Nadir Concordant. All save Silent Onyx. . .
				-Blood Stained Wind found the mirror while we broke open the tombs of The Neverborn
				 retrieving it from sunken Oceanus.
				-Vaznia sought the mirror, meaning to prove our crimes against the Solar deliberative
				 and we, sworn to keep each other's secrets, kept it from her.
					-She was unaware, at very least, of Blood Stained Wind's membership in the
					 Concordant.
				-Blood Stained Wind recommended that we kill Silent Onyx, before he discovered the
				 secret of her, and our, betrayal.
				-"What, though, was the mirror?", we asked her. "Why did Vaznia want it?"
					-"Larquen told me some things about it. He said it could twist the essence of a
					 Solar that looked into it, and that such things would enable greater mastery of
					 the dead."
						-Hmm. . . that reminded me of the deathknights,  
					-She also mentioned that the mirror was a shard of obsidian glass, and one that
					 shed cold to the extent that she was forced to carry it wrapped in many layers
					 of cloth.
					-Well, that did not sound like the mirror we found, though I felt compelled to
					 check, showing it to Blood Stained Wind.
					-She confirmed that it was not the mirror she spoke of, but said that she _did_
					 recognize it, and was surprised Vaznia had kept it.
						-It was the work of mortal hands, but a sentimental object, the mirror
						 through which Vaznia had once watched her as she brushed Vaznia's hair.
				-We were less than enthused about murdering Onyx, and worked to talk Blood Stained
				 Wind out of it.
					-She eventually relented on this score, but still seemed uneasy, and asked that
					 we keep her secret, and the secret of this mirror, from Onyx.
					-On the latter, I had some concerns. What if he found, and _looked into_ the
					 mirror?
					-We decided it was best to at least inform him of the mirrors danger, though
					 we could certainly keep silent about our part in it's presence here.
		-We joined Silent Onyx in the chamber down the hallway.
			-He said he believed he'd found the way forward, and we in turn warned him not to look
			 into any cold obsidian mirrors, lest it "twist our essences".
				-He was thankfully incurious about how we learned this.
		-Following the path Onyx had found, we found a chamber containing a ramshackle door set into
		 a marble archway and a strange white-jade plate, 10' across, and studded with runes and
		 blue crystal spiked caltrop shapes.
			-The door seemed constructed from debris from the manse above, and featured a keyhole.
			-The plate, meanwhile, had a key and swordhilt with a shaft of bamboo growing from it,
			 lying near the center of the plate.
				-I recognized it as a species of magnet, but knew no more.
				-Onyx claimed he could likely open the door without the key, but we wanted that
				 sword. . .
				-As such, Golden Blade stepped onto the plate, and all of us suddenly felt a tug
				 towards it.
				-Most of us managed to find a handhold to grab onto, but Libak was sucked towards the
				 plate and it's caltrops.
				-He was nearly impaled on one of the caltrops, but his anima flared as he used a
				 charm, and the spike failed to pierce his now oak-hard skin.
				-A moment later, the magnet's force reversed, and all of us were suddenly being
				 pushed towards the ceiling.
				-This time, though, all of us managed to hold on.
				-Finally, magnet's force relaxed, Onyx opened the lock on the door, the rest of us
				 quickly following him.
					-Libak even managed to grab the bamboo-bladed sword.
		-This chamber featured a large porcelain mask who, at our arrival opened it's eyes.
			-"Halt!", it said, first in Old Realm and then repeating it in many languages. "Speak the
			 password or die!", it continued, again repeating it in each language, then finally
			 shouting in all at once, "You have 30 seconds!"
			-After a stressful 28 seconds, Pip recovered a timely memory of her past incarnation,
			 speaking the password and yielding a "Greetings, honored ones." from the mask, and an
			 open door.
			-We passed through it into the next door, and left off the session there.


9/27/21:
	-That last door led to yet another hallway, with a door at the end.
	-Bloodstained Wind and Silent Onyx scouted ahead, checking for more traps, and eventually opened
	 the door.
		-It led to an altar, a small golden dais, standing before a statue of The Unconquered Sun
		 that was depicted holding up the ceiling.
			-The plaque said, "Through me, you are exalted."
			-I having approached close enough to read the plaque, the statue's eyes lit with golden
			 solar essence, writhing like flames.
			-As I stepped into the room, the writhing essence flared, and a bolt shot forward at me.
			-I thankfully dodged it, in no small part because it shot at my hip, or seemingly at the
			 paired jade blades hanging there.
			-Well, this is a place of The Unconquered Sun, and those the tools of the Terrestrials.
			-We decided to shed such items for the moment, stashing them in the cache egg.
				-I kept, though, both my bracers and the phylactery. They being Orichalcum, I
				 reasoned they may be allowed.
			-Sure enough, stepping again, tentatively, into the room, I was spared another blast.
		-We saw no exit from the room, though.
			-A careful examination, though, revealed scratches along one wall.
			-They looked like the marks of a bladed weapon, but went far too high on the wall for
			 most to reach.
			-We examined the ceiling above, and Silent Onyx was able to spot the outline of a
			 tightly fitted trapdoor.
	-I boosted Onyx up and he was easily able to push the door out of the way, leading to a narrow,
	 roughly cut tunnel, which he climbed into.
		-He eventually shouted that he'd reached a grid made of up of ominous looking beams of
		 essence.
		-I shouted up that the Amulet of Shadowwalking could likely take him past it, and indeed it
		 seemed to.
		-After most of an hour, without hearing from Silent Onyx, we heard a great crash, from
		 somewhere else within the manse.
		-At that, I had Blade boost me up, and I climbed down the tunnel.
			-It was indeed as Onyx described it, the grid of beams still there.
			-I saw no way to disable or bypass it myself, and told the others it looked as Onyx
			 had said.
			-Libak turned to Bloodstained Wind, and asked _her_ if she could perhaps make it through,
			 shapeshifter that she is.
			-She flew up to examine it with me. As she did so, her eyes changed, from lizard,
			 to bird, to mammal.
				-As she did so, her forehead began to glow with a silver-y light in the form of a
				 crescent moon.
			-After a moment, she said that she _could_ pass through the grid, but that we had missed
			 something, and she began to scratch at the plaster of the nearby wall with her newly
			 formed claws, slowly revealing a plastered over doorway.
			-I called for the others, lowering a rope for them, and we passed through the doorway,
			 down a tunnel that neatly circumvented the grid.
			-From there, we seemingly followed in Onyx's footsteps, through a series of strange rooms,
			 until we reached a section of hallway where the walls moved, slamming into each other
			 and then retracting, again and again.
			-I thought I could make it through, but was not sure we all could.
			-Golden Blade volunteered his, well, blade, and jammed it into the mechanism behind one
			 wall as it attempted to retract.
				-Using the blade as a lever, and pulling with all his strength, he broke part of the
				 wall free from the piston it connected too, releasing a great gout of steam.
				-After that, the wall moved no more, and we were through.
	-Just through there, we found Silent Onyx, himself having recently clawed his way through some
	 fallen stone blocking his passage back.
		-"Come," he said, "I've found more coffins to loot."
		-He led us to a set of four small coffins, that he began checking for traps.
		-None found, we opened them, finding some empty, but in one we found a strange looking mask,
		 double-faced and grisly, part of it broken.
		-Golden Blade froze at the sight of the mask.
			-When he finally spoke, he said that he had seen this mask before, worn by The Mask of
			 Winter, as he conquered Thorns.
		-I, too, recognized the mask: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/892218728081657866
			-"you have a small memory of making this mask, using meherrin's skin... the last thing
			 you made before being thrown into that hole by Ozandus Pal...
			 not an artifact, just a grim trophy of your most savored kill"
		-The chamber also held a mask on one wall, which now began to speak (seemingly on a timer).
			-It named us trespassers, but said that the children of The Unconquered Sun were merciful
			 (seemingly not recognizing us as among them) demanding we swear an oath to leave the
			 manse and tell no one of it.
			-Onyx, though, in breaking and clawing through the blockage in the passage behind us, had
			 already removed it's leverage. . .
		-Onyx also showed me a bit of Old Realm he'd recorded, scrawled in one of the earlier rooms.
			-"He was too crazy. We had to kill him. I took that stupid mask he made, broke his legs,
			 threw him in a hole, and covered him."
			-I (unwisely?) read that aloud as I went. . .
		-Given this grisly thing, what do we know about ghosts?
			-They're attracted to the blood of the living, and are attached to things they were
			 passionate about in life, including sometimes pieces of their bodies.
			-Humans have two souls, the hun, the higher soul, and the po, the lower soul. The hun can
			 become a ghost, while the po can rise as a "hungry ghost".
			-In a Shadowland, ghosts are tangible and real, and can even have children, the "ghost
			 blooded".
				-Thorns is now one such Shadowland, and Sijon a particularly famous one.
	-Onyx was heavily taxed getting this far, and suggested we rest a bit, before continuing on.
		-One of the rooms we had passed through featured beds, some bolt hole for the Solars of the
		 manse.
		-We agreed that would be wise, closed the room's doors, and set a watch.
		-My sleep, though, was troubled by dreams.
			-As I slept, I felt cold and, waking, could not move (sleep paralysis).
			-The mask we'd recently recovered tumbled around the bed, rising then into the air, the
			 eyes like vortexes.
			-It spoke: "I will find you. I will make you suffer."
			-I awoke, but knew myself to still be dreaming. I was in one of the bedrooms above,
			 emaciated, and began to crawl from bed, towards the door, only to be stopped by a man
			 with a golden staff, shaped like a tree branch, who grabbed me and began to drag me.
			-I tried to fight him, but could muster little strength, as he dragged me downstairs and
			 threw me into my tomb. The last sight I saw was the slab closing off the light above,
			 though the dream continued, through hours (days?) of scratching at the walls of the
			 tomb. While I scratched, I began to hear voices, voices agreeing I'd been cheated,
			 robbed of what should have been mine. Serve us, they called, and all of it would be
			 mine. . .
		-Libak, upon awakening, told me my First Age incarnation was a dick.
			-I acknowledged that I had become conscious of the same, since arriving here.
			-I asked him, though, why he said that now.
			-It would seemed he dreamed too, of the origin of the mask. . .
			-I acknowledged that I knew too, and offered a sheepish apology.
				-He, thankfully, seemed confident those earlier incarnations were not _us_, and we
				 had a good philosophical debate, confident in the end that we could succeed where
				 they failed.
			-In discussing the matter, a thought occurred to me. Larquen had been _jealous_ of
			 Meherrin, jealous that he had achieved _The Second Circle of Necromancy_. The price
			 The Primordials had demanded of Larquen was service, a price he was unwilling to pay.
				-Did _Meherrin_ pay the same? Does that have something to do with why The Mask of
				 Winters wears _this_ mask? 
	-We then resumed where we left off, sweeping the room with the coffins, and finding another
	 plastered-over door.
		-It was thoroughly locked, like a vault, but, with Onyx's help, we eventually had it open.
		-It led to another hallway, and then eventually to a room with four more doors.
		-We opted to first backtrack to the T-intersection, and check those other two doors,
		 before continuing down this lengthy branch.
	-The first door there we opted to open was marked with an air symbol.
		-Onyx checked the door for traps and, finding none, opened it onto a swirling vortex of blue
		 energy, and a freezing wind.
			-His thin form is not suited to such things and, slamming the door, he came away freezing.
			-Libak was feeling bold, though, and had recently learned Charms to deal with very much
			 this sort of thing, and opted to open the door again himself, as we took shelter around
			 the corner.
			-He could weather it no better, though.
		-That sent us back upstairs, to warm the pair of them in the tubs above.
			-While they soaked, though, I, and Bloodstained Wind to stave off any further attacks,
			 went to go let the Lunars and Terrestrial know we were still alive.
				-They seemed fine, if bored, reporting no attacks or the like.
				-The Terrestrial Dynast requested something to read, and I said I'd see what I could
				 do, though warned her most of the books in the manse had been destroyed.
					-I debated the matter with the others, once back below, but we had nothing that
					 wasn't full of terrible secrets, or just terribly priceless.
	-It took the pair of them several hours to recover, but we eventually returned to the maze,
	 heading back to the T-intersection.
		-We were a bit reluctant to try the remaining door, but Golden Blade was characteristically
		 bold, and reached for the the knob on the door marked with the water symbol.
		-The door would not budge, but he began to cough up sea water, then bits of kelp, and even
		 a fish.
		-Thankfully, and not coincidentally, he's also the one of us best equipped to bull his way
		 through the effects of an attempted drowning, and he survived it without ill-effect.
	-From there, we returned to the five doors in the room in the South.
		-Silent Onyx now did a thorough check of the room, wary as we were of the many "obvious"
		 doors in earlier rooms that proved to be traps.
		-No other doors, or traps, were found, but two of the five doors here showed signs of
		 having been opened. One had bits of stone debris in front of it, while the other had
		 scrapes before it, like things had been dragged into it.
		-Trying the door something had been dragged into, I found a treasure trove.
			-It contained (all in Roll20):
				-A pair of Orichalcum and moonsilver torcs 
				-An instrument
				-A jagged shard of black jade, with a handle wrapped in dingy leather
				-A plain Orichalcum mask.
				-A breastplate.
				-A hookah.
				-A wujong blade, or so I thought. When I looked away, and back, it was now a cutlass.
					-This sounds familiar to me.
					-Yep, it's The Forgotten Blade in Roll20, though, strangely, I seem to be the
					 only one who can consistently recognize it without being attuned to it.
				-A pair of orichalcum hearthstone bracers.
			-They all were arranged, like a ritual altar, around a flat object wrapped in white cloth.
				-Silent Onyx, quite sure what it was, grabbed it, and wrapped it tighter.
				-Libak asked if Onyx thought that was a mirror and, at Onyx's nod, offered his
				 jacket to wrap it further.
					-Onyx mentioned "not being sure how I feel about the memories of my last
					 incarnation", but felt strongly that this was a thing to take great care with.
					-This was all rather out of character for him.
				-Bloodstained Wind, at the sight of it, looked panicked, and looking from Onyx to
				 rest of us and back, she turned into a snake and fled.
					-We made no attempt to stop her or follow, with several of the others convinced
					 she'd soon return with the other Lunars, though I'm less sure of that.
				-We decided the safest place for such a thing would be our Cache egg. We'd trust it
				 to no hands but our own, but also keep it safely (?) Elsewhere.
	-After examining the treasures for a bit, Onyx went to mark the other _used_ door.
		-He sooned called out to me, as the inside was covered in Old Realm writing.
		-It was a messy scrawl, much of it gibberish, but a few repeating lines formed a coherent
		 theme: "I did it! I killed him, but now the voices in the mirror call to me. The only place
		 I'm safe is here!"
		-Venturing further into the twisting, rough-carved room, following the writing, I came to a
		 desicated corpse. It lay beside a long staff, clearly an artifact, and had around it's_
		 neck a hearthstone socketed in an amulet.
		-Clearly, I've found Osandus Pal.
		-As I approached to retrieve the hearthstone, the corpse sat up suddenly, shouting, "No, not
		 you! Anyone but you!", only to tumble to dust afterward, followed by what seemed to be a
		 wind that swept past us, out the way we'd came.
	-Pal's preferences aside, I grabbed the hearthstone, and the amulet it was in, and, with our
	 major goal in hand, immediately set about attuning to it.
		-I can now see through any mirror in the manse.
		-I can also see that the manse's essence flows are being forced into a disharmonic state,
		 causing the level of the hearthstone to fluctuate. This appears to be due to the fact that
		 something has crashed the barriers preventing I Am from accessing every portion of the manse.
		-In fact, from what I can now tell, and despite what it said, I Am seems to very much be
		 fully functional. . .
		-As if in response to this probing of the manse's systems, a voice, seemingly coming from
		 everywhere, began to shout, "No!!! It's mine!"


10/1/21: A First Age Interlude
	-Jeff not being able to make Council of Wyrms, Lesley, Jake, and I played a one-shot thing as
	 our First Age selves.
	-Hmm. . . Larquen's character sheet suggests _his_ Metasorcerous Phylactery works with Necromancy
	 too.
	-Both Morning Star and Larquen are members of The Black Nadir Concordant.
		-Morning Star dispises me, though, like most.
		-Study of The Underworld is strictly forbidden by The Solar Deliberative, but we said
		 fuuuuuccck that, and of course did so.
		-We delved into The Underworld from Sijan.
		-Once there, we entered The Labyrinth, and in it's heart, broke open the tombs of the
		 slain Primordials, and stole the secrets of Necromancy.
	-After that, we met in Denandsor, The Empty City.
		-The city is a showpiece of the Twilight caste, a display of their crafting prowess.
		-Meherrin, Aure Orchester joined us there also.
		-There too were Kal Bax, his apprentice Osandus Pol, Daveg, and Itraxian.
			-The four of them help rule the city.
			-Bax was the one who called us there.
			-He named the other four of us as ones who'd taken the forbidden journey to The
			 Underworld, in the same breath as he admitted interest in making the same journey.
			-He then pulled out a strange puzzle box.
				-Made of strange black ore bound in Orichalcum.
				-Examined with Sorcerer's Sight, the thing is fucking crazy, folded space, necromantic
				 energies, and portals.
				-"Where did you get this?" Morning Star asked. "I made it."
					-"Why?" "Nothing should stand in the way of progress. Certainly not sanity."
				-"What do you intend to do with such a thing?" I asked. "I intend to journey to the
				 heart of The Underwold, stepping through this device."
				-"What do you want there?" Morning Star asked. "I have heard the whispers in the
				 deep caverns, speaking of secrets take to the graves of the slain Primordials."
			-He told us that any who were afraid to go should leave now, and then began tinkering
			 with his box.
	-Nothing happened at first, but then, in the blink of an eye, we were elsewhere.
		-At least, Morning Star and I were. The others were nowhere to be found.
			-Was this a mistake? Or intentional? We both strongly considered the latter. . .
		-We were clearly in The Labyrinth, surrounded by pillars topped in pools of icho.
		-I knew this place as The Pools of Consumption, an area _within_ one of the tombs of
		 The Primordials.
			-The tomb of The Perfect Principal of Consumption.
		-There too is The Palace the Forsaken, at the heart of the tomb, though The Many
		 Mounds lie between us and there.
		-Movement, in The Underworld, is strange, though, a matter of will, and of the wills
		 of the nearby Neverborn.
			-Spending a Willpower _will_ get you where you're going, but attract The
			 Malevolence.
	-With my guidance, we navigated from there to The Many Mounds, heading to our destination.
		-This area was a biomechanical Giger homage, populated by sickly looking birds, cancer-
		 ridden and missing patches of skin.
		-As we travelled on, we encountered a tall, skinny figure, wrapped entirely in leather,
		 bleeding from the eye holes.
			-I recognized it as Endless Consumption of The Flesh, a component soul of one of The
			 Primordials.
			-Morning Star warned it was ready for a fight, and I fell into my Snake Form, but, as
			 it continued to just stand there, I studied it, engaging first my Sorcerer's Sight,
			 and then my Flawless Diagnosis Technique.
				-It _is_ ill. _Deeply_. It shows signs of a vast number of vile diseases, and from
				 the essence flows surrounding it, it seemed to be _radiating_ the same.
			-Battle it was, then.
				-It acted first, attempting to infect us with something horrible, though it was
				 warded off by our Resistance charms.
				-Morning Star then swung at it, but missed the quick moving horror.
				-I, though, surged forward, muttering command phrases that turned my skin to
				 bronze and hands to claws, and, with the aid of Supreme Perfection of Martial Arts,
				 ripped it's chest open, to examine it's insides.
				-As I did so, I also employed Ghost Eating Technique, sucking, Marceline's-Dad-like,
				 it's very essence from it.
					-_That_ seemed to put some fear into it's eye-holes.
				-Morning Star then finished it off with her blade, with some sadness from me, denied
				 the opportunity to see to it's final destruction as I'd hoped.
	-We took advantage of Morning Star's summoned-for-the-battle flying battle armor to take the
	 rest of the journey in the air.
	-Eventually the biomechanics dipped lower, beneath crystal-clear water, over which we flew,
	 eventually reaching the fortress at it's center.
		-Setting down at the gate of the fortress, we thoroughly investigated the area, looking
		 for signs of Bax and the others.
		-No signs of _living_ passage, but _something_ massive came through here, apparently dragged
		 deeper into the fortress.
		-As we walked inside, we were greeted by anothe horror, though this time in a much more
		 civilized fashion, with a bow.
		-It asked us why we came, and I responded we'd come again in search of the secrets of its
		 kind.
			-Its terms remained the same, though, and I would not agree to service.
		-After some beating around the bush, it let us know Bax was indeed somewhere near here.
			-It offered to bring them here to us, or us to them.
			-In return, it wished us to convince Bax to build "the machine he has seen".
				-It was cagey about what this machine was, though it mentioned a phrase: "I AM".
					-It said also that the machine would protect us, and that it would benefit _it_
					 as well.
				-I was reluctant, but wished to see this machine. It may serve the ends of this
				 creature, but may also offer the opportunity to learn much of _it_.
				-I agreed, and it indeed brought the others too us, walking off as they appeared.
		-Bax asked us if we had brought him here, seeming fascinated, and I acknowledged as much,
		 but, before he could ask for details, though, I asked _him_ how it was we came to be
		 scattered so.
			-With Judge's Ear Technique active, I believed him when he claimed it was a mistake,
			 babbling about how "the math is experimental" and "the machine is apparently not
			 perfect".
		-He then asked us if we knew how to navigate this place, and I confidently asserted that
		 we did.
			-He wished to speak with Scream of the Void Answered in Blood, supposedly the architect
			 of much of this place, and asked us to take him to The Pools of Consumption, as it's
			 to be found in a building therein.
			-We accepted, and then asked him if he had a means of flight, at which he nodded and
			 pulled out a tiny metal bird that he proceeded to wind up.
	-Bax cast Open the Spirit Door, and we used it to climb inside his tiny wind-up sparrow, which
	 then took wing.
		-The inside was appointed like a lavish passenger ship.
		-Therein, I asked Bax about this Scream of the Void.
			-I asked if it was part of The Perfect Principal of Consumption, and, indeed, he said
			 it was, a fragment of it's purest soul.
			-He said too that it was once a thing of balance, before it was destroyed, and became
			 Scream of the Void Answered in Blood.
			-He thought that, with Scream of the Void, a kernal of that remained, and could be
			 restored.
			-He spoke of some "vision", of many brains connected by gleaming golden wire, floating
			 together.
				-This seeming to be the "machine" he was called to build, and I eagerly encouraged
				 him.
			-He also spoke of making attempts to create true life, rather than simple automatons.
			-I'm feeling some genuine interest in this project. Very much along the lines of my
			 interests.
		-As we flew, we all began to hear vague, indistinct "whispers". Ominious. . .
		-We eventually reached The Pools of Consumption and began flying a search pattern.
			-It was Morning Star who spotted the membrenous dome that matched Bax's description.
		-We landed, and emerged from the sanctum-sparrow.
			-Bax pulled out an amulet with a hearthstone set in it, placing it about his neck and
			 beginning to glow (clearly the hearthstone of The Invisible Fortress).
			-He then hobbled, favoring his right leg, over to the dome.
			-Unfazed by the lack of an entrance, he cut through the membrane and we followed him
			 inside.
			-The inside was grosser than the outside even.
			-Eventually, a series of worms emerged, forming into a ropy, humanoid figure.
			-A buzzing began in our heads, eventually forming into Old Realm speech.
				-Bax, staring at the thing, walked forward, and fell.
				-He bounced to his feet again, surprisingly quickly, and I, mumbling about the "old
				 fool", walked forward to help him with Touch of Blissful Release.
				-I then asked the creature if we were addressing Scream of the Void Answered in Blood
				 and it nodded. "Bax?" I then asked.
				-He walked towards the creature, and it reached out with one of it's tendrils,
				 touching him.
					-As soon as it did, he fell to the ground, in an apparent seizure.
					-I crouched down to examine him, but did not reach out to help.
					-Eventually, another tendril emerged from his mouth, this one bearing a perfectly
					 cut emerald.
					-Morning Star reached for his blade, but I said, no, this may merely be the way
					 it communicates. . .
					-A few moment later, Bax opened his eyes, and then immediately bounced to his
					 feet.
					-He then spoke: "Strange. It asked for the memories of my time spent as a mortal.
					 And now I understand."
						-A price worth paying in my eyes. A price Garn later _would_ pay.
					-He did claim to know what he came to learn, and we then took our leave.
	-Kal Bax used the puzzle box to take us back to Creation.
		-A fascinating device. Though I was not going to admit it, when it worked correctly, it was
		 a far easier journey to and from the Tombs than my first trip.
			-"I would love to study your creation, 
			 "It will be waiting in Denandsor for you."
			 "Very well. I will find some time to examine it."
		-Bax could not resist begining work, and 
			-"Bax, do let me know when your machine is complete. I would love to examine it. . ."
			 "Of course. I will likely have need of your. . . unique skills in it's construction."
	-Skipping forward 150 years. . .
	-I receieved a message from Morning Star of a battle on the caldera of a volcano on the border
	 of our territories.
		-It's a Dawn Caste and a Sidereal fighting, their anima banners flashing and visible for
		 miles.
		-This caldera houses a particularly devestating weapon system. Think mechanical-dragon-nuke.
			-"The Thousand Forged Dragon"
		-Within moments, my dragonblooded soldiers were there, informing me of the same conflict.
		-I had them ready my warbird, and soon was racing towards the conflict.
		-Soon, I was able to see the two combatents on the caldera from the crystalline screens
		 inside the warbird.
			-One I recognized as Contentious Blade, the Solar who Morning Star has sworn to kill.
			-The Sidereal was a stranger, dressed in a red ninja gi
		-I had my officers take the warbird in low, and cast Mists of Eventide on the combatents
		 from it.
			-The Solar was affected, but the Sidereal somehow grabbed the spell and _threw_ it back
			 at me.
				-As he did so, the symbol of Mars glowed on his forehead, such that a halo of red
				 surrounded his face.
			-Falling asleep behind the controls of an aircraft being unwise, I put quite a few motes
			 into an excellency as I resisted it.
		-I brought the warbird in for a landing on the rim of the caldera.
			-In the sky to the East, I could see Morning Star's people coming.
			-"What is going on here?" I asked the Sidereal, "This is. . . not an auspicious place
			 for this conflict."
			 "My hands are stained with bronze. They will be the hands that purge you from creation."
		-Very well. Battle it is, then.
			-I fell into Snake Form as he entered The Five Magical Materials Style.
				-Weirdly, his essence suggested he retained some other form active too, a thing that
				 should be impossible.
			-He was fierce, but I was quick. Though his counterattack drew first blood, mine kept
			 coming, and kept pace.
			-Morning Star was slowest, but her blows were mighty. The third of a flurry of blows
			 from her fists _shattered_ our opponent.
		-We did not have time to enjoy the success, as the caldera suddenly erupted with a great
		 explosion, one that a charm-fueled Morningstar thankfully parried.
		-From there, we turned our attentions to the still sleeping Contentious Blade, who had
		 somewhat surprisingly survived the blast, likely due to his own Dawn Caste resiliance.
			-"I suggest you make it slow, Morning Star. We need to learn what is going on here. . ."
			-It took some Willpower, and another grisly sales pitch that she should maim him before
			 waking him, but she resisted killing him.
			-We flew him back to my laboratory, in the flying pagoda.
			-After some consideration, I suggested Threefold Binding of the Heart as the best means
			 to render a Solar mostly harmless, and, asleep, he could offer no resistance to the
			 mind control. I cast it after some rest and refreshments, since I needed more motes.
			-When he awoke, he asked us why we spared him, to which Morning Star replied, through
			 gritted teeth, that we need information.
			 "Why," Morning Star asked, "Were the two of you fighting."
			 "I was ambushed by that Sidereal and his army of demons. My own men turned against me.
			  Something. . . something is wrong. We have to get word to the Solar Deliberative."
				-Morning Star scoffed at that last.
			-"Did you know this Sidereal? Do you know who he was?" I asked.
			 "He was the advisor to my men. He had worked for me and my circle. . . It's the strangest
			  thing. The more I try to remember, the less I do. I can barely recall what his face
			  looked like."
			 Morning Star: "Your usefulness is fading as your memory does. You should try to remember."
			 "Kill me if you must. Before you do, know that this may be happening to others."
			 "What have you heard?" I asked.
			 "Rumors. An attack in Denandsor. Kal Bax has been named a heretic, the rest of his circle
			 with him. The Dragon-blooded are rising up, attacking us."
			-With that, his usefulness, all that was staying Morning Stars hand, was at an end.
				-I simply left the room to go get another sandwich.
	-From there, we went South, towards Denandsor, to see about the truth of these heresy rumors.
		-Kal Bax spotted us on the way, from his pleasure yacht, and picked us up.
		-He said he'd tried to travel, via the Auspicious Gate and through Heaven, but that only
		 brought more of them, their pursuers.
		-Their eyes settled on Morning Star. "You killed the only means we had of seeking aid."
		-She was unapologetic, though. So they sent her away.
			-"We're sending you to Maru, take the lunars, message must get through to The Heirophent.
			- warship, manned by humans, not dragonblooded, all Tiger Warriors, and all clones of Larquen Quen
				-"Don't worry about it, Morning Star."
		-Meanwhile, the rest of us traveled North, to The Invisible Fortress.
			-On the way, Bax told me he'd completed his project.
				-"It can potentially replace a Solar. It's call I AM. It's there, to the North, and
				 it can help us. We'll be safe."


TODO:
	-Put artifacts in a spreadsheet. You offered in Discord already.
		https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/892499305317941269
	-Who was that last voice?
		-I AM?
		-The ghost of Osandus Pal?


10/11/21:
	-You do now have some sense of what happened in the First Age one-shot, Lesley saying you've
	 now seen that in a dream.
		-Interesting ethical/philosophical debates are thereby enabled, as Golden Blade / Morning
		 Star was OK with mind control, more insideous and absolute than mundane slavery.
	-Probing the systems my newly attuned hearthstone, I could tell the voice was indeed I AM.
		-The whole manse reacted along with the voice shouting. Essence flows throughout it were
		 suddenly rerouted into new, dramatic patterns.
		-I warned the circle that I AM had been misleading us! It's indeed fully functional, and
		 the cause of this!
	-The manse around us was also suddenly, and strangely, transformed.
		-Through a mix of my Occult and Lore, plus what I now had access to through the hearthstone,
		 I knew I AM had plunged us into a dreamscape, perhaps with it's recorded charms.
		-I (really Lesley) ran the circle through the basics of this strange place, both still the
		 manse and not at the same time.
			-https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/897262993019138100
	-I shouted that we needed to head to the hearthroom and confront I AM.
		-To move to the hearthroom, I imagined myself aided by a golden dragon, my anima banner,
		 and, indeed, then was. I rode the creature off to the heartstone room.
		-The hearthstone room was also transfromed.
			-The statues of solars were replaced by ones of strange cherub-people, mangling their
			 own faces or tearing out their inards.
			-The paintings of the Unconquered Sun were replaced by black, sucking voids.
			-The dais and orichalcum circuitry normally at the center of the room was replaced by
			 a huge, pulsating brain, surrounded by tumerous growths.
		-Onyx and I had arrived first.
		-I had burst into the room on the back of a shining dragon, symbol of myself, but also of
		 Larquen, who had a hand in this thing's creation.
		-Thus, I took an imperious tone, and demand IAM to show himself!
		-Before me, then, materialized a shining man made of golden light, though one looking quite poorly.
			-Bits of him seemed damaged or missing, while others were strangely rearranged, one small
			 arm and one giant one, etc.
		-Golden Blade and Libak then arrived.
		-"What is the meaning of this, I AM?" I asked, "Why have you betrayed your purpose, usurped
		 your masters?"
			-In response, I got another claim that, "It's mine! You can't have it!"
		-In response, the room shifted, the floor turning to swirling blood, excepting an island
		 around the brain in the center of the room.
		-Golden Blade sailed the bloody seas, on a suddenly-there ship, arriving at the island in the
		 center.
		-Silent Onyx too lept forward, drawing a blade, and stabbed at the brain.
		-Pip then arrived.
		-I AM was clearly hostile now, turning to Onyx and striding towards him.
		-I then joined him in this, with a flying dragon kick, as again my anima appeared, soaring
		 over me and pulling me free from the blood as it did. I then soared with it, food forward,
		 slamming into the brain.
		-In response, the room changed again, the blood now flying, swirling into the air, while the
		 golden figure of I AM fell to his knees clutching his head.
		-I, fast as a snake, now acted again, at the same time as Golden Blade. We both tried to
		 convince this thing that it did not have to be like this.
			-I, imperiously, and half consciously channeling Larquen, who had a hand in it's creation,
			 asked if it had had enough? "See what happens when you defy your masters? Tell me what
			 it is you want!"
			-Golden Blade, meanwhile, offered it mercy, saying it didn't have to be like this, we
			 could help it.
			-Both though, were answered only with a sneer.
		-It and Pip now acted.
			-She surged forward on the walking armchair she'd strangely rode into the room on.
			-The chair danced forward on it's legs to the brain, and Pip demanded the brain reveal
			 it's secrets. In response, compartments on it slid open, revealing circuitry, and an
			 enormous crystalline sphere of orichalcum.
			-I AM, meanwhile, screamed, "None of you can have it! I'll kill you all!"
			-As it yelled, an enormous, razor-studded hand appeared above us, and slammed down upon
			 all of us!
				-Most of us managed to dart between it's fingers, but Pip was hit, and was now
				 staggered and bleeding.
		-Libak then leaped into the air with new, golden wings, flying up high and then dropping
		 down onto the brain, looking to shatter it, and the dream with it, dealing it another
		 grevious blow.
		-Next, Silent Onyx renewed his attack with his blade. This proved the final blow, as the
		 brain exploded in a blast of white light, wounding all of us (though my anima flared and
		 absorbed most of it).
		-At the center of the room, there was a now a broken column, surrounded by shattered bits of
		 glass and Orichalcum, and an Orichalcum orb with Onyx's blade embedded in it.
			-I could also feel the hearthstone then pulse once more, and then go steady, stabilizing
			 as a normal level 5 hearthstone.
	-At that point, we also became aware of the a great clamor: wolf howls, and shouted questions.
		-In short order, the Lunars entered the room, Two-Faced Raven carrying the dynast.
		-Silver Maw Bliss went immediately to Golden Blade, shoving his lupine nose towards Blade's
		 wounds, smelling them.
		-Through the access to the manse  the hearthstone granted me, and with out I AM impeding me
		 any longer, I was free to observer the whole of the place.
			-I could see a small prison cell with a set of manacles (The Manacles of Night) made
			 from a mix of Orichalcum and Soul Steel, which we retrieved
			-The manse also featured a chapel we'd not yet visited, though, looking over it, nothing
			 much caught my eye.
			-And a sculpture studio, which contained a set of "Wound Mending Needles" that Golden
			 Blade has since claimed.
			-Another room also held two sets of bracers, one pair of Orichalcum, and the other of
			 green jade.
				-The first are The Perfected Kata Bracers.
				-The latter seemed to be covered in jade circuitry, connecting crystals.
					-I recognized them as Bracers of Universal Crafting, which must be surgically
					 implanted.
	-After clearing out the manse, and confirming it was secure, we took several days to rest and
	 recover, but also to pour over our artifacts, and ask more about why the Lunars had come.
		-Two-Faced Raven had a proposition: cast off these artifacts, forget this manse, and leave
		 civilization. Learn, with them, to become a great Exalted, in harmony with nature.
			-They met a chorus of no's, though, to which they responded, "Fine. Keep your toys. You
			 will need them if we meet again."
			-Bloodstained Wind, meanwhile, said, "My sister is brash. If we meet on the battlefield,
			 I won't look for you." She then departed as well.
			-Silver Maw Bliss, with eyes only for Golden Blade, said to him, "I won't lose you again.
			 In time, you will see the wisdom of Two-Faced Raven's offer. I will watch over you, and
			 if you need me, you need only call out my name and I will be there."
	-Well, what next?
		-Rishi and Hawk presumably still wait for us.
			-Do we want to turn any of this over to them?
		-The trip back will certainly be very difficult.
			-The food Libak brought back could be stretched to last the winter if we're careful.
		-Most of us seem interested in spending the winter here.
		-There's the demon army outside to consider too.
			-They provide us a good deal of protection, but were also brought here for _construction_,
			 and could aid us in repairing this manse, or procurring more food.
	-We spent the winter at the manse, training and digesting the new wonders at hand.
	-I did indeed make use of the demons, spending my next couple of weeks getting them in line.
		-I extended their leash by a mile, and made use of them in hunting new food, but also in
		 felling timber, and starting repairs on the manse.
		-I offered them large shares of the food and materials both, the latter to improve their
		 town of Gateway.
	-In the downtime, spend your now massive pool of XP!
		-Lesley said you can purchase anything from your First Age sheet, or from Favor and Caste
		 charms from the Core book, or even teach eachother known charms.
		-Essence 4 will consume all of your training time, but otherwise you effectively have more
		 than enough to do whatever (don't bother tracking, Lesley said, save for Essence boosts).
		-Proposal: 98 to spend
			24	Essence 4
			5	Occult 4
			5	Lore 4
			5	Dodge 4
			7	Occult 5
			7	Lore 5
			7	Dodge 5
			--
			38 remaining
			Applied!
		-Essence boost limits picking up charms, but these are things you're inspired to work
		 towards, while looking at this:
			-Lore training charms are available at Lore 5.
				-Not free XP as it turns out, at least for players, but can reduce training time.
				-For _NPCs_, though, it's straight free skills.
			-Celestial Sorcery is now possible, but a whole narrative thing you'll need to
			 work on with Lesley.
			-All the cool Sorcery charms are now available, at least with Occult 5.
	-Each night, while we trained, we felt ourselves drawn to the black mirror.
		-Only Onyx did not feel it's call, at least while it remained in his possession.
		-Eventually, Libak was finally the one to retrieve it from the cache egg, doing so while
		 Onyx was gone.
		-Through his carelessness, we all end up seeing it at some point or another, save Onyx, who
		 we kept this from.
			-The experience was deeply strange, and more than a little horrifying.
			-Your essence inverted, and you felt you could channel it into strange new patterns.
			-Your motivations, though, also felt strange. Your most fervent dreams felt unimportant
			 and things once abhorrent failed now to shock, even holding some attraction. . .
			-As a result of this, all of us by Silent Onyx gain dot of Whispers.
	-After the thaw, we ventured back from the manse to Wangler's Knob.
		-The journey was not easy, but was now _possible_.
		-I commanded the demons to remain, and to continue construction on both the manse and the
		 town of Gateway.
			-While they cleared new land for wood, they found small wonders for sale or delivery
			 to our allies .
				-Some Wyld-touched iron, a rarity, given iron typically repells The Wyld.
				-We also found a small topaz mine, bringing back pounds of them, a small fortune's
				 worth.
		-Reaching the town, it now seems split into two camps, with a no man's land between.
			-One side was dominated by the dynast's from The Realm.
			-The other feature banner's bearing the sigil of the town itself, and those of many
			 mercenary bands, including Hawke's.
			-Finding Hawke, he asked us only if we were successful. Responding yes, he immediately
			 set about ordering a retreat.
			-This town is doomed, he said, with reinforcements from The Realm arriving daily.
			-He'd managed a treaty allowing Hawke's Chargers to safely retreat, and wanted out of
			 there as soon as possible.
	-The journey back to Nexus took 3 weeks.
		-Our dynast and deathknight joined us.
			-Rishi, asked about the latter, said he'd offered her many foods, but she accepted
			 nothing. He _did_, though, catch her grabbing and devouring a rat that strayed near
			 her.
		-During the journey, I trained, the details of which will be just below this session's notes.
		-During that time, we also handed over the Wyld-iron, and the topazs.
		-Rishi pressed us for any information we'd divulge, but we were tight-lipped.
		-Hawke was largely incurious, but did ask us to confirm that a force of the dynasts had
		 been killed by demons. We confirmed it.
		-The crew now looked at us as legends, having survived what seemed impossible, and having
		 also brought back enough (if they knew. . .) to make the whole trip worth it for all of
		 them.
		-In the ports we stopped back on the way home, we heard rumors that The Realm and Lookshy
		 were gearing up for war.
			-There were rumors of blockades by The Realm of Lookshy trade, and other boats stopping
			 all comers, demanding a tax (basically pirates).
			-The Marukani, long allies of Lookshy, were dealing with their own attackers, to the
			 South, from minions of The Mask of Winters.
				-The Seventh Legion is said to be refusing to help them.
			-Silent Onyx wisely pointed out that this was quite odd, for The Realm to launch a
			 major war.
				-With The Empress having disappeared, they should be in turmoil.
				-We asked out local dynast what she thought, and she was of the same opinion as
				 Onyx, though warned she was a season out of the loop.
	-As we arrived at Nexus, Hawke got a report from his men there.
		-The city certainly is in turmoil, it's underworld in chaos, with factions warring on one
		 another.
		-Apparently there have been kidnappings, targeting the friends and family of the leadership
		 of different underworld factions.
		-Onyx suggested this sounded like the work of a deathknight, and so I suggested we consult
		 our captive one. We woke her with her stolen heart, and asked her if she thought the same.
			-"There are a few," she said, "that I suspect it could be. Disciple of the Seven Forbidden
			 Wisdoms, or The Wink of the Storm's Eye would be capable of this."
				-Blade actually recognized the latter, and he has another name: Typhon.
				-He is Thorns's ambassador to The Confederation of Rivers, and a servant of The Mask
				 of Winters.
					-The Confederation meets in the town of Marita, several hundred miles to the East
					 of Nexus.
				-The former is also a servant of The Mask.
			-Throughout this, she kept giving me odd looks.
				-I asked her if there's something more and she said, "I hadn't noticed it before, but
				 there's something familiar about you."
				 "Speak. I confess I have a suspicion. . ."
				 "You remind me of my master. . ."
				-At that, Garn hung his head and did not speak.
			-She also, then, took notice of Pip's shortsword, retrieved from the tomb of her past
			 self.
				-"You recognize this blade?" I asked.
				-She asked Pip, "Can you draw it?"
				-As it was drawn, it grows from shortsword to orichalcum daiklaive, with sutras
				 written along it's side, and a name: Sunspeaker.
				-At the sight of it, she screamed, fell backwards, and started crawling back away
				 from the exposed blade.
				-Pip sheathed it and, when she had calme a bit, she spoke: "What you carry is The 
				 Howler in Darkness," she said, "Where was The Silver Prince buried?"
					-Pip recognized the name, she being a native of Nexus. They're a Deathlord.
						-And, then, is her First Age self The Silver Prince?
					-Libak also got a look of disgust on his face, apparently connecting some dots,
					 and spoke, ". . . I think Meherrin may be The Walker in Darkness. I remember
					 making a deal. . ."
					-I then confessed that I suspect Larquen Quen became The Mask of Winters.
					-The deathknight looked shocked, but then asked us if we knew the tale of
					 Princess Magnificent.
						-Those of the circle from Nexus did. She had ruled a Shadowland near here,
						 and had warred on Great Forks.
						-It looked like she might win, but the guardians of Great Forks eventually
						 found something, a connection to her original body, or maybe the weapon that
						 killed her.
						-The lesson was rather clear.
			-She also asked again, "What is to become of me?"
				-Rather than answer her, I asked, "What would you do with you? Were you free? Return
				 to your master?"
				-"I am bound to him. I would, but would go first to The Underworld."
				 "Bound to one or bound to another, huh?"
				 "Under The Mask, I had freedom."
					-Garn, silent for a bit, eventually just walked away.
	-Unloading the ship took a day.
		-At the end of it, we were each given 2 talens of silver, our shares, granting us Resources 5
		 for the rest of the month.
	-The kidnappings continued, now including nobles, merchant families, and other centers of power.
		-The strange thing, though, that has really riled people up, is the fact that The Emissary
		 has not acted against a single person. . .
		-A group called the Tang Zen was at war with another, The Black Syndicate, along with a
		 child gang ("The Crows") and a new-formed gang of Terrestrials ("The Triple Threats").
			-All sorts of trouble is being caused by that, but still The Emissary does not act.
		-Pip's mother also came to see her, thankful for her return.
			-Apparently she'd been barely able to eat, owing to what she has had to pay in protection
			 money to a snakemen gang.
			-Pip is enraged, and intent on doing something about that.
		-I did some drinking with Blade and Hawke's men, to celebrate our success (again, if they
		 knew. . .).
			-The chaos of the city was well evident while we were out.
			-We also heard rumors of the disappearance of the very poor in Nexus too.
				-The guards have been writing it off, but the working class is worried.
				-Some body parts have been found in the water near the docks, and in other waters
				 throughout the city. Could be the work of animals, but rumors abound about some
				 kind of monster.
					-Sightings were rumored in the Firewander district, at night. A big silver mass
					 seen moving across the rooftops, and supposedly in and out of the Wyld-zone
					 there.
			-Much carousing occurred, and we even found ourselves in an underground fighting ring
			 for a bit, to many cheers.
			-Eventually we found our way back to Hawke's compound, where Golden Blade keeps a room.
			-I found a message waiting there for me, from my monks.
				-They asked me to come to the monastery, and, obliquely, suggested I "avoid the
				 usual ways", what I understood to refer to my Wooden Face spell.
		-The next morning, a very angry Libak came in, slamming a piece of paper down on the table.
			-"I can't believe it," he said, "They took my brother."
			 "Who," I asked, "took him?"
			-In response, he gestured at the paper.
				-Reading it, it was a contract between his brother and Ophilis Ses. It's a work
				 contract, but harsh, indentured servitude with no limits, and no mention of
				 payment.
			-"Why would he sign such a thing?" I asked.
			 "They forced him to!"
			-"Who is this Ophilis Ses?" I asked, "A member of the gangs?"
				-Libak told us he is said to be the leader of the Tang Zen. He's rumored to be a
				 snakeman, and his organization is said to have taken control of the local snakemen
				 cartels.
			-I informed them I had a. . . family matter of my own to deal with, but (somewhat slyly)
			 suggested that Blade would of course wish to remain, the contract being tantamount to
			 slavery.


TODO:
	-Talk with Lesley about whether the monastery journey should happen in session or between.
		-Sounds like he's flexible! Could do a special session if I'm going by myself, or could bring
		 the rest of the circle in session.
		-Sounds like we're going for the solo option.
			-Use those rings, to communicate while gone? Look at the description again.
				-OK, yeah, sounds like your location is mostly safe:

				-Depends a lot on what armor you eventually buy, I guess, since you may not need
				 it's most desirable benefit after all.
					-No luck finding Exalted armor weights, but found other references.

			8	1 day Third Lore Excellency

	-Look for other items to spend that jade on!
		-Get ritual implements and such for summoning.
			-Your new jade should serve well here.
			-Pg. 28 of Books of Sorcery Vol. V has more details.
				-Resources 2 _building_, and Resources 1 expendable stuff per demon.
				-Or spend more, for bonuses.
		-Armor is probably most attractive.
			-Lesley on what's available:
				Light and medium armor of any quality can be found, but exceptional or perfect armor will require a week or a month to allow for fittings and adjustments to be made for your particullar frame
			-Perfect Lamellar would reduce your temp Resources (who cares), but you can get it down
			 to no Mobility or Fatigue penalties without Empowerment, and with the +1 to both soaks.
			-May obviate Ritual of Elemental Empowerment?
				-Ah, there's always extra soak from the Earth Benediction.
				-Exalted doesn't address it but light internet research suggests lamellar armor
				 should fall within your weight limit.
		-Plates from The Abiscissic Guide?
			-See pg. 31 of Books of Sorcery Vol. V.
			-Ah, or, the next page says my dots in Occult should mean I know it already, unless _not_

				-Soak: +7L/9B, Mobility: -0, Fatigue: 0
				-Yep, ordered this. Ready in a month. Would normally require you to be there, though,

					-Mechanically: If something botches, something could go wrong with the armor.
			Resources 3		Materials for an elaborate demon summoning cage (Two sets?)
				-Pg. 28 of Books of Sorcery Vol. V for this and the next thing.
				-Is this portable, at least before final assembly?
				-One to bring to the monastery and one to store in Nexus is my ideal.
					-Could demons summoned at the monastery then identify it's location?
				-What will people in Nexus think of someone gathering these things?
					-Answers:
						-Definitely avaliable, due to free market ethos.
						-Cages come in two forms: modern, literal cages, and First Age,
						 glyphs/diagrams.
						-Yep, you should be able to carry components back to the monastery, but
						 set up/tear down time means this is hardly _portable_.
						-Invisible Manse also had a summoning set up off the library. Very posh, it
						 supported demons up to third circle and ghosts.
						-You can definitely buy even high quality versions.
						-10 sets of components would drop resources a dot. Get 5 of them.
			Resources 2		Rarified demon summoning components (get 5)


10/14/21: A Solo Adventure
	-On the way out of Nexus, you ordered your armor and bought demon summoning equipment, leaving
	 one cage setup stored at Rishi's.
	-For the trip, I again headed to Nexus's docks, and found a ship going West down the Yanaze.
		-My pockets a bit heavier right now, I booked a room on a luxurious yacht going that way.
		-Powered by magical contrivances, this boat was quite quick, and I disbarked only a day
		 later, to head South from the river.
		-The towns I passed seemed untroubled, not plagued by whatever is going on amongst the
		 Marukani further South. No reports of the undead or the like.
	-As I neared the manse, the surrounding are seemed strangely. . . silent.
		-No herdsmen with their sheep, even few natural sounds. . .
		-At the manse itself, I could not hear the usual sound of prayers.
		-The place was quiet, save the occasional shout, in unison, of training monks.
		-As I walked up to the entrance to the monastery, I saw one of my monks, Sister Lian,
		 standing guard at the door.
			-As I approached, she said, "Thank the gods you're here! He showed up, and he's let us
			 do nothing else since."
			 "Who is he?"
			 "Brother Jiaho found. . . some kind of entrance at the back of a closet. He removed
			  the stone, but only made it a short distance within before alarms sounded, and he
			  turned back.
			  From the back of the closet, though, later, a light shown. . . and _he_ came. He
			  looked just like statues of. . . you, before. He wears a horrible suit, like a
			  demon writhing around him.
			  He knows all the signs and mudras, but he is not like you."
			 "You said he let you do nothing else. . . Other than what?"
			 "He said we were too weak to be his followers, and makes us train. . ."
			 "Where is he having you train?"
			 "In the courtyard, but he waits below."
		-She took me to to the closet, where a stone removed from the floor revealed a stairway
		 going downward.
			-I went creeping down the stairs.
			-At the bottom of the stairs, there was only swirling light.
			-I had no idea what it might be, but he had emerged from it, and I boldly strode into
			 it.
			-On the other side (Of what? Am I still in the manse?), I found myself in a hallway.
				-It smelled. . . weird, dank and acrid.
			-It lead to a room on the right, and then a stair up at the end of the hallway.
			-Peeking around the corner of the room's door revealed a large chamber, and a. . .
			 humanoid of some kind.
				-It was covered in swirling, writhing gold, and was looking away from me.
				-It stood before a doorway, through which I could see some kind of tube, made of
				 some golden translucent material.
				-It noticed me, and spun it's head 180 degrees, then followed that with it's feet,
				 and began to walk towards me. The swirling gold covering his face then pulled back,
				 revealing the face of Larquen.
				 "So, you must be the reincarnation. You bear the hearthstone. Why are you so weak?"
				 "You are not Larquen Quen."
				 "I am, a backup copy. I retain most powers, but am missing one thing. It was supposed
				  to be mine. . .
				  It does not matter. What are you going to do with it?"
				 "I am going to do what I am fated to do: restore the glory of the lost First Age."
				 "Have you forgotten what was intended? Why rebuild a glorious age that never
				  existed? We can forge an empire instead!"
				 "To rule, but to what end? You speak of power for it's own sake. . ."
				 "What other sake is there? I have been reduced greatly, but I, I still remember how
				  to wield some powers. Not my greatest magics, but still much of the sorcery I've
				  learned. I must know, will you join me, with Creation's mandate, and forge an
				  Empire?"
				 "First, what last do you remember?"
				 "The final configuration of this project, before Quen retreated to a manse to the
				  North."
				 "I saw his last moments. You seek to repeat the same mistakes."
				 "We can bring a new age. We can rebuild, and we wouldn't be alone. Come."
				-I had strode towards him, over the course of our conversation. Now, he led me into
				 the room he'd been standing before.
					-It contained dozens and dozens of golden tanks, each containing a humanoid figure,
					 and a swirling golden mass.
					-Many of them are cracked or broken, containing only rot and bones.
				-Again, he spoke, demanding, "Join me. We will forge a glorious empire."
				 "Creation cries out for it, but how do you mean to do it?"
				 "The people of this age are weak. They will be easy to conquer."
				 "Why conquest, though? So many just need aid, guidance."
				 "It is necessary. It will show them their place."
				 "The world cries out for a savior, not another conquerer."
				 "It will show them we are above them. They _will_ know their savior."
				 ". . . I think you are intent on making the same mistakes. There is so much to
				  learn, but I do not think you want to."
				-He then tried what I recognized as Peacock Shadow Eyes on me, to no effect."
				-Recognizing it, I fell into Snake Style, to a look of astonishment on his face. It
				 seemed he could not believe I'd defy him.
					-He dodged several attacks, with a surprisingly malleable form, bending inhumanly,
					 then collapsing into a puddle to dodge by swipes, before forming into a great,
					 fanged maw and trying to bite me.
					-As I dodged the maw, a single claw swipe in passing finally connected, dealing
					 it a small wound.
					-Suprisingly, that led to him yielding.
				-"Wait, we need not fight!" he said. "I see that you are the stronger. We can still
				  work together."
				 "Is that so? To what end?"
				 "Whatever happened here damaged the dragon lines. I was only able to rouse and send
				  out three from here."
				 "Send them out for what?"
				 "To understand.
				  We do not need to fight. We can work together. I knew Quen's power, what you
				  are capable of. I recognize you are now strong enough to kill me."
				 "I would rather not have to. So much has already been lost."
				 "That's why you should listen."
				 "How do you mean to stand atop such an empire, personally? If the Exaltation should
				  have been yours. . . it is not. How now?"
				 "The Underworld holds great power. Power we can use."
				 "You would not stand atop that empire. You and I both know the price of the
				  Underworld's power."
				 "That deal was offered to Quen, not to you."
				 "Would it differ, for another?"
				 "It could. What would you give up for power?"
				 "A thing I know all too well, and a question near to my mind. But service to the
				  Neverborn. . . I would not accept. It would not be power I gained."
				 "Things have changed. Where is the nearest Shadowlands?"
				 "Thorns, at least, is one such. Why?"
				 "Where is Thorns?"
				 I described it's location, Southwest along the coast from here, to him.
				 "If you wish to learn Necromancy, go there."
				 "Not the easiest thing to do. I have heard fearsome things of it's ruler."
				 "What Solar rules there?"
				 "No Solar. A servant of the neverborn, perhaps a ghost."
				 "What is a ghost to us?"
				 "I have known exalts that walk in fear of it. I would not discount it out of hand."
				 "Where do Solars rule? What of the Solar deliberative? That trouble in the South
				  couldn't have impacted things elsewhere."
				 "It is cast down, and centuries gone. I know of no survivors."
				 "Really? Then none can stand in our way!"
				 "There are the Dragon-blooded, who purged the Solars."
				 "Dragon-blooded?!? Purging Solars? Hmm. . .
				  We should wake the others."
				 "First. . . what are you? What am I dealing with?"
				 "Put simply, I am a clone, a bio-$something replicant. Something failed. . . I
				  didn't capture the Exaltation. . .
				  I've retained access to my knowledge, though, my martial arts and basic spells."
				 "Could you make more such creations?
				 "I could make more, but no sample from Quen would still be good, unless Quen's body
				  could be found."
				 "You could make these from anyone?"
				 "Yes. I could make copies of you, or others. It. . . comforts me that you would
				  not be able to do so without me.
				  But, without. . . certain surgical procedures, they would be blanks. Still useful,
				  if you can train them, though.
				  With materials, I could also form more of these chao-morphic symbiotes."
				 "I had wondered what that was. It is not a thing I remember Larquen using."
				 "It is not a thing we were meant to use long."
				-He then walked over to another door, off the great room, opening it to reveal a
				 laboratory, filled with surgical equipment, and other devices.
					-Including some grisly, preserved organs.
					-And some equally grisly books, judging from the titles and diagrams on those I
					 glanced at.
					-"Lacking materials for further symbiotes," he went on, "Perhaps we should focus
					  first on new clones. Do you have a circle?"
					 "Yes, I do."
					 "Get the Dawn Caste's DNA. We will use it to make warriors. I regret to inform
					  you that none in this manse are worthy, though. All were once Tiger Warriors.
					  It is a shame to see them in this sorry state."
					 "As I said, I once thought life in this manse was hard. If this was as far as
					  the world had fallen, I would count us lucky."
					 "Show me then. Take me somewhere. Show me what we're dealing with."
	-He then led me back through the swirling light, and up the stairs leading back to the manse's
	 closet.
	-Lian still stood near the top of the stairs. He walked up to her, looked at her for a moment,
	 and then said, "I told you to bow when I approach. He then kicked her in the kneecap, shattering
	 it, and she collapsed.
		-I grabbed him by the shoulder, yelling, "That is not your place!"
		-His face twisted with rage, which he quickly masked, saying, "I cannot talk to you when you
		 are displaying unearned compassion like this. I will await you outside."
		-I went to Lian, and called two monks over to help her.
		-I told them there is much to learn here, but also much danger, and followed him out the door.
	-Outside, another Larquen-clone was walking up, with a woman, quite clearly a deathknight.
		-Much of her black wardrobe was seemingly corsetted with bones and studded with strange black
		 metal. Across her back she wore a wicked looking daiklaive.
			-Image of her: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/898398879735746600
		-The approaching clone addressed the one I'd me, saying, "Number 1, who is this?"
		 "I am The First Light's Dragon." I confidently asserted.
		 He looked at me with surpise, saying, "You're the one. Interesting."
		-The woman then looked to me, smiled, and said, "I've heard of you. . . A very strange tale
		 indeed. I heard you were responsible for attacking Lord Hilo's domain, in search of another
		 of my kind. Did you rescue her from the fey?"
		 "Not quite. . . Vestiges of the fey's bonds remain. . . Who, though, are you?"
		 "I have no name. What would you call me?"
		 "I name you deathknight."
		 "That's what you would call me?"
		 "I would call you what you are called."
		 "Then know me as The Maiden of the Mirthless Smile. I led the vanguard at Thorns."
		 "I see. I know someone who would very much like to meet you." I said, earning me the
		 aforementioned smile. "And I see one of the clones has brough you here." Looking to them,
		 I asked, "Why was that?"
		 The new arrival, who'd brought her, then said, "She seemed to know much of the area, and
		 to understand. Number One would wish to talk with her."
		 #1: "She did not attack you?"
		 #3: "She tried. I see you faced trouble of your own." To me, "You are mighty to have landed
			  such a blow."
		 "Well then," I said, turning to the deathknight, "What have you come to tell us?"
		 "I am more concern with what you would tell me, of where my sister is."
		 "Is she so dear to you?"
		 "No. I would slit her throat if you have not done it for me. But, if she lives, our master
		  wishes her return."
		 "Who do you serve?"
		 "The Mask of Winters."
		-Seeing a grimace on my face, in response to that, and then silence, she turned, and made as
		 if to leave.
		-"Hold!" I shouted, "This is a secret place."
		 "I will tell no one. On my honor."
		 "Even your master?"
		 "I will tell him nothing he does not already know. . ."
		 "What does that mean?"
		-At that, she only smirked, and took off running.
	-Garn gave chase.
		-Turning to look at me over her shoulder, I could now see a Dawn caste mark on her forehead,
		 though one seeping a black. . . vapor, rather than shining.
		-She then _vastly_ increased her speed, leaving a red blur behind her.
		-In response, I spoke, saying, "The dragon takes wing." And with that, my suspended casting
		 of Stormwind Rider was made manifest, and I was swept up into a racing whirlwind, still
		 giving chase.
		-That netted me only a horrible laugh, though, as she _still_ put on speed, and grew the gap.
		-Eventually, she raced _down a cliff_ and away, shaking my pursuit.
	-Shouting behind me, a clone caught up, now only a short distance behind me.
		-I whirled around and back towards him and, dismissing the spell, dropped to the earth, my
		 rage plain on my face.
		-"How could you expose this place so?!?"
		 "I defeated her. She is weak, and she brought only knowledge of Necromancy."
		 "And if she returns with an army?"
		 "There is one here."
		 "You had called them weak. . ."
		 "All the more reason to awaken the others."
		 ". . . She said something about what her master already knew. Do you know what she was
		  talking about?"
		 "Yes. I assisted her in summoning a ghost, through which we sent word to her master. I
		  could not summon her master, though. . .
		  I would not worry. She could not overcome you, and ran."
		-I returned with (apparently) clone #3 to the door of the monastery, where #1 waited for us.
		-As we approached, he began to question #3, asking, "What was this equipment she wore? The
		  strange metal?"
		 "She called it Soulsteel, taken from the Labyrinth."
		 "Meherrin was right, then, and it has it's own material. . . I wonder what it's properties
		  are."
		 "She was generous, and gave me this," #3 said, holding up a black torc. "She said her
		  master would not miss it. It has aunique property."
			-Putting it on his arm, he threw a punch at the air. As he did so, the torc let out a
			 horrible, cacophonous wail.
		-"Fascinating," the first clones stated, "Can I see it?"
		 "There is no need. You can see it from there."
		 "I am the first, your master."
		 "You are not my master. . ."
	-A fight ensued between them.
		-They both employed Snake Style, in combination with weird, shapeshifting strikes,
		 enabled by their symbiotes.
		-#1: "Respect me!"
		 #3: "I am the greater! My own master!"
		-I was quite content to look on. One of these clones is nearly as useful to me as two,
		 and far less dangerous.
		-In the course of it, clone #3 lost the torc, it flying to the side.
		-Eventually, one fell to his knees, with the other tearing him apart with his claws,
		 and then _eating_ him, with his symbiote maw.
		-He then grabbed the torc, mumbling, "Mine. . ."
		-I'm fairly sure #1 survived, but it's hard to tell.
			-That _may_ be the neck wound I dealt him, but many other gashes have joined it.
	-I was still enraged, shouting at the wounded survivor, "A powerful enemy, invited here!"
	 "All the more reason we should awaken the others. If you would listen to me. . . We
	  should gather the required materials."
	 "I. . . would know more of this proces. What is this material you speak of?"
	 "We need vitriol from Malfeas."
	 "Something a summoned demon could provide?"
	 "No, they cannot carry it with them. You must enter Malfeas. I am now mortal, and would
	  not survive, but your Exaltation would preserve you."
	 "I would need a way. How does one enter Malfeas?"
	 "I know a ritual." he said, striding off. "It is already prepared."
	 "I would know more of this ritual. One should not jump headlong into hell. If I could bring my
	  circle. . ."
	-He led me inside the monastery's grounds as we spoke, and then into one of the buildings.
		-There, in a room within, the clone gestured to a disembowled, but still living, monk, his
		 entrails strewn in about the room in what looked like careful lines and patterns.
		-It was Brother Huan, a friend. Close in age, we'd trained together for many years.
		-The clone simply walked past him, to a table, and began sorting through papers and grisly
		 instruments, babbling about how it would be a five day walk, to Malfeas and back, for me,
		 but that time passes differently there, and that the ritual would ensure my return mere
		 minutes after my departure.
		-In my rage, I barely heard him, and I strode towards his turned back.
		-Despite my stomping, he was so proud of his ritual and preoccupied with it that he remained
		 oblivious pushing the claws into his throat and tearing, continuing until I had ripped his
		 head off.
		-In response, the symbiote shrieked, fell away, and then slithered over the disembowled
		 form of Brother Huan.
			-He began screaming as the thing covered him, his intestines slithering back in.
			-Eventually, his form entirely covered in the golden mass, he stood.
			-Stepping toward me, the symbiote retreated from his face, as he grabbed me and hugged
			 me, saying, "It. . . I don't know how. . . it has healed me?"
	-I led him out the door of the building, calling over two of the more junior monks to help him.
		-As I did, the gold slowly melted _into_ him, until it was no longer in evidence.
		-The two monks I'd called over led him off, to get some rest, at very least.
		-As they stepped away, I gestured to another monk, a senior thaumaturge, calling him over
		 to me.
			-"Keep watch over Brother Huan," I said. "He has been exposed to something unknown, of
			 The First Age, that golden thing our. . . late visitor wielded. Let me know if there is
			 any change or development in his condition. I will be checking in regularly, even once
			 I leave here again."
	-I then gathered the rest of the monks in the courtyard to me.
		-"I'm here now. That. . . thing is gone.
		  It claimed, though, to have awaken three more of it's kind. Were there really only four
		  of them?"
			-A couple of monks spoke up, and, yes, as best any could tell, no more than that were
			 seen.
		-"What were those?" one among the crowd shouted to me.
		 "They are remnants of The First Age, another backup project in case The Last Light's Dragon
		  were to be destroyed. The project would seem to have failed, though. . .
		  They brought an outsider here, though. We are all in grave danger. She was a minion of The
		  Mask of Winters."
		-In response, another of the senior thaumaturges offered to surround the manse in wards
		 against the undead.
			-"Yes, make it so."
		-Addressing again the whole of the crowd, said, "Two more things! Tell me, by the fastest
		 means available if you see more of the clones. I will be checking in more regularly, via
		 the tree. And, don't go in that closet, or the passages beyond."
		-"You seem troubled," one of the monks called out. "Are we really in that much danger?"
		 "Yes. Very much so."
		 "We'll protect the manse. . . but we'll flee if we must, taking all the knowledge we can.
		  We can go to Nexus. It's where you'll be?"
		 "Yes. If you must flee, find me. As you know, you should be able to reach me, either at
		  the compound of Hawke's Chargers, or at Silver-Tongued Rishi's estate."
		-Another monk then called out, one who was trusted to travel outside the manse. He said,
		 "We have remained hidden so long, but I have met others, who could be of help."
			-He spoke of a cult of "illuminated ones", some of whome are in Nexus, and who seemed
			 to have a. . . compatible doctrine.
			-I've heard some word of such a cult, popular with the street people of Nexus, and
			 strong in the Firewander district.
			-Their beliefs, he told me, involved 5 promises, including that The First Age would fall,
			 but that the gods would still send champions, their shining ones. "Are you not one such?"
			 he asked me.
			-"There is wisdom in that suggestion," I told him.
			-He then instructed me as to how to find them, saying, "When last in Nexus, I met a man
			 named Joseph One-Shoe. He had nothing, but helped me when I dropped my things, returning
			 my things and coins to me. He stood with me while I gathered my things, and then took
			 me to get some tea. I found him in The Little Market of The Nexus District. Perhaps he
			 is the one you should seek."
			 "I shall. Allies are needed. I have met some I trust, but more will be needed with the
			  magnitude of the task before us.
			  We should also step up our recruitment, and the time may soon come when we will need to proselytize further."
	-The monk who suggested it then began work on wards against the undead, surrounding the manse.
		-It took him more than a day, pinning up paper strips with Old Realm sutras and
		 sprinkling powders in ritual patterns around the entire perimeter of the manse.
		-He was exhausted by the end of it, saying only, "It is done," and then collapsing where he
		 stood.
			-I asked a couple of the monks to carry him to his bed.
	-I stayed at the monastery for a couple more days, for my comfort and theirs.
		-There was one scare when a common hungry ghost passed through the wards, triggering alarms,
		 but it was successfully destroyed by the inner ward, happily confirming their efficacy.


TODO:
	-Summon demons.
		-Bottle bugs?
			-Help Lian with this? Maybe even examine the symbiote guy?
		-Agatae?
			-Lesley suggested this as a good option for getting between the monastery and the
			 river, at very least.
			-Not _totally_ remarkable that sorcerers exist. Not clearly an anathema.
			-Mortal sorcerers, in fact, exist, and this is a little more common to them than Stormwind Rider.
				-Nexus, in particular, is _mostly_ accepting.
		-Deer?
			-There are options for keeping summoning it, to keep it quiet.
			-Can mark and track!
			-Track the deathnight? You have her torc.
			-Track the remaining Larquen-clone?
		-Lesley said don't worry about rolls for this first batch.
			-Basically certain, given that you can spend motes, willpower, etc.
		-Added them to the temp notes, with detailed instructions.
		-They required three nights at the monastery to summon.
		-Send Lesley stuff about the immediate uses you put them to.
			-Healing Sister Lian's knee.
			-Riding the Agatae to speed the trip back to Nexus.
			-Posted that here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/899853594042445854
		-Figure out the Abscissic Bindings.
			-See pg. 31 of BoS vol. V.
			-Lesley's info about how many you know:
				-Pick plates you remember up to your Essence, and can of course track down and buy
				 more.
			-Compasssion, Conviction, and Valor all show up among your first three demons' high
			 virtues.
			-Attractive sounding plates:
				-The Ecstatic (Compassion):
					-Solid for the bottle bugs.
				-The Hunter (Conviction):
					-Solid for the deer, Demjen, Heranhal, and blood-apes.
				-The Slave (Temperance):
					-Probably the more dangerous of the two temperance ones, but very Larquen, and
					 thus what you'd likely have been exposed to.
				-The Warden (Valor):
					-Good valor option.
			-Wrote those down in macros.
			-Now assign bindings to the demon's you've summoned.
				-Done!
	-Send a message to Golden Blade?
		-Given what the torc shares, he clearly knows something is up.
		-Ah, and, actually reading the Torc's description again, it shares a ton, so he probably
		 gets a very good sense of what went on.
		-Sent him a description of what comes through _automatically_ here: https://github.com/Peaked13/Exalted/blob/main/Characters/The%20First%20Light's%20Dragon/campaign_notes.txt#L2849
		-In the way of reaching out to him, however conversation happens, I think it's time to admit
		 the existance of my manse to the circle, and to ask for help. It's in danger from powerful,
		 and somewhat shared, enemies, and you could use allies coming to it's defense.
		-Yep, I talked to him in the next session, and asked for help, admitting the existence of the
		 monks, and saying that they're threatened by The Mask of Winters.
	-What is that torc?
		-Examining it, it does nothing, and is simply made of Soulsteel. Looking closely, though,
		 it's covered in faces, the source of that screaming when it's moved.
		-Turn it over to the monks for examination and research? Many among them are skilled
		 thaumaturges, and they have access to a library specializing in that too.
		-I know Soulsteel to involve combining ore from the Labyrinth with the higher, hun soul of
		 a ghost.
	-Seal that hole in the closet.
		-(DONE!) Still haven't explored the stair up in there.
			-Do this before leaving.
			-It led to another room containing further notes and lab equipment. This time, the notes
			 concerned the creation of the symbiotes.
		-Sealing it:
			-I'm going to physically seal the entrance to this area by having the agatae and the
			 monks work together to move a bolder over it, ruling out any further lone explorers,
			 at least. Then, I'll have several of the thaumaturges among the monks layer some alarm
			 wards on the area, to alert them to any further attempts at getting in or out.
	-How long since these clones were loosed?
		-Ask the monks.
			-The first clone awoke 3 _months_ before I arrived. The others have only been awakened
			 a month.
	-Address the monks further.
		-No more exploration. If such discoveries are made, let me know, and await instructions.
		-Pep talk:
			-"You support me, sustain me, and are the only family I have.
			  Our great work is now beginning, and soon every one of us will be needed, to bring
			  about a glorious new age. _Creation_ needs each and every one of you, every bit as
			  much as I do."
			-Maybe make a Charisma+Presence check?
		-"I will be checking in with you nearly nightly, via the carved face."
			-Mentioned the procedure to Lesley.
	-Research "chao-morphic symbiotes", or set the monks to doing so?
		-Ah, actually, there were some notes concerning them in the hole.
		-Looking into it, it's a result of Craft(Genesis), and is a kind of living superweapon.
			-It is an intelligent thing that can mimic the forms of Wyld mutations.
		-See "chromatic symbiote" in Roll20 for how it works.
	-Sent Lesley the above five things here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/902032340312809482


10/25/21:
	-As I made my way back to Nexus, the others reunited at Hawke's compound, a week after we'd
	 returned to Nexus.
		-Silent Onyx had been looking into the silver monster, which turned out to be some strange
		 blob of liquid silver, emerging from the Wyld zone and doing various things. Following
		 people, absorbing them, sneaking around, etc.
		-I also heard what happened with Golden Blade, as it happened.
			-He killed a sewer monster that had been abducting children, likely the source of the body
			 parts in the water. Some mustached figure fled from the scene, though, so perhaps there
			 still exist conspirators.
			-In the course of that, he also acquired a follower, Sparrow, a young boy with a shaved head.
			-He was also jumped, in revenge for our assault on Lord Hilo, though dealt with them easily.
		-Pip had also found an ally, at some place called "The Tomb of the Night", but was unwilling
		 to say more where others might hear.
			-It _does_ sound like she may have again revealed her Solar nature, to an even bigger
			 crowd.
			-The others went with her to this place, finding it beneath a bridge she led them to.
			-They were greeted there by a strange, green-ish woman, speaking in pidgen.
			-Pip indicated to her these were friends she had brought, to the delight of the woman.
			-She insisted on touching each of them. As she did so, a caste mark on her forhead flared,
			 a simple golden circle, like Silent Onyx's.
			-It was she that noticed the child, Blade's follower, who remarked at her caste mark,
			 with wide eyes, saying, "She's _another_ illuminated?!?"
			-Blade tried to dismiss the child, sending him back to Hawke's compound, but the strange
			 woman insisted he stay, saying the area is dangerous.
			-She led them into a dark passage. Soon, an _impossibly_ dark passage. Something was
			 strange there.
			-Eventually, she led them to a small, dimly lit room, with several doors opening onto
			 it. In fact, _strangely_ lit, seemingly black and white, leeched of all color. Perhaps
			 the result of warped essence flows?
			-Is this one of the six Solar tombs of Nexus? "The Tomb of Night" is one such, and it's
			 said to swallow whole those who step into it's darkness.
				-Pip confirmed it was indeed the tomb.
				-It appears to be a manse as well. Perhaps this Night Caste woman is attuned to it.
			-In any event, the strange woman indicated the place was safe, and introduced herslef as
			 Hyula.
			-Pip then began to speak of Ophilis Ses, saying he'd gained control over all of Nexus's
			 gangs, and had killed Hyula's lover. This is the source of their alliance, as
			 Hyula desires revenge.
			-Pip also said she met one Silver Wind, an anathema hunter. Uh oh.
			-Thankfully, Pip had learned many things of the snakemen gang, learning the location of
			 many snakeman hideouts in the Firewander district, and that some of them were keeping
			 profits for Ses, a potential wedge to use.
			-Unfortunately, she and her mother are also now homeless, their home having been burned
			 by the snakemen.
			-Golden Blade then reached out to me, checking on my ETA.
				-Reaching the river by Agatae, I had found a fishing boat to ride back into Nexus
				 on, and was only a few hours away. I arranged to meet them soon.
			-The room was also filled with paper covered in crude writing, but detailed maps,
			 apparently Hyula's investigations into Ses.
				-They ran through the locations of Tang Zen hideouts that Pip and Hyula knew.
				-One of which was curiously right on top of the sewer where Blade fought his monster.
			-They discussed how best to get to Ophilis Ses, and Hyula volunteered that he had a
			 boyfriend, somewhere outside Nexus, and a son, who is currently missing.
			-I arrived around that time, and Blade, Libak, and Hyula went out to fetch me.
			-As she led all of us back into the tomb, I asked her how she and Pip had met. She
			 pointed to her caste mark and then to me. "Yes," I responded, our kind does indeed seem
			 to be drawn together.
			-All of us reunited, Hyula then spoke of what went on at several of the Tan Zen sites.
				-Their armory held many weapons, bearing a finely wrought pattern, some kind of set.
				-At their "factories", one near the sewer with Blade's monster, they _make_ monsters.
					-Golden Blade described a thing made from stitched together corpses.
			-I also asked Pip for some details of this anathema hunter, and what people saw of her.
				-She indicated 200 plus people may have seen something they shouldn't have.
				-She did not know if this hunter was of the Wyld Hunt, but did not think so.
	-In our pursuit of Ophilis Ses, we decided to raid the site the Tang Zen were keeping slaves,
	 an issue of personal concern to Libak and Blade both.
		-As we traveled, the city was clearly troubled. The homeless, in particular, bore improvised
		 arms, guarding barricades built of trash.
		-The Tang Zen site was in The Brood Market, a slave market in the city.
		-Stepping into this place of suffering, though, Libak flew into a rage.
		-He strode towards one of the slavers, taking bids, and punched him straight in the face,
		 scattering the coins on his table.
		-Golden Blade also looked queasy at the sight of the market and, when Libak flew into his
		 rage, Blade held back for a moment, then shrugged, and joined in.
		-He ran to the slaves at the auction block, and began striking off their chains.
		-Libak continued his rampage while Golden Blade employed charms to both rally the freed
		 slaves into a unit and to disperse a group of mercenaries that was pushing towards us
		 through the crowd.
		-Well, this was neither what I signed up for nor what I expected binding myself closer to
		 the circle would mean, but they still _are_ my best allies in the face of the deathlord
		 that now threatens my home. I fell into Snake Style, and activated my Essence Fangs and
		 Scales Technique.
		-Pip, though, tried to tackle Libak, seemingly hoping to stop the rage.
		-While they brawled, I saw Silent Onyx slipping off. Running up to him, I asked him where
		 he was going.
		 "To complete our mission," he said.
		 "I'm with you, then."
	-Onyx and I found ourselves at the warehouse in question, marked with the their sign, three red
	 triangles.
		-I asked Onyx how he wanted to do with this and he simply said, "Silently."
		-I nodded, and said, "I'll be on those crates," pointing to some across the alley down the
		 street, "Just give me the sign." I continued on down the alley, sat on one of the crates,
		 and pulled a book out of my bag. I could see the warehouse's front door and a side door
		 from there.
		-Onyx inspected the building. It lacked windows, and the roof was strangely prepared, covered
		 in herbs and charcoal. Nearing the building, that seemed to be covering a smell, as it stank
		 of rotting meat.
		-Onyx relayed as much to me, and then crept in through the front door.
		-He returned a few minutes later, to report what he'd seen, and avoid someone moving about.
		-Inside were several zombies, packing boxes.
			-They were placing pouches of some liquid into the boxes, and then covering that with
			 other goods, concealing it.
			-Onyx retrieved one of them, giving it to me. I tucked it behind the crates I was sitting
			 on.
		-In another room, he also heard someone talking.
			-A man's voice, he mentioned a scalpel, sewing, and later something about finding the
			 children again, they being "the only thing I can work with." A muffled response, from a
			 woman, followed by movement, is what sent him out the door.
		-He returned inside, and looked further, attempting to sneak into the room the voices were
		 coming from.
			-He was overcome by the stench, though, and stumbled, attracting their attention.
			-Before he fled out the door, he saw a mustached man, bent over a small corpse with it's
			 lungs removed and splayed out around it. He was accompanied by another man, one with
			 a satchel of herbs and charcoal over his mouth and nose.
		-This relayed to me, we discussed our next move, settling on the other door.
			-With charms, Onyx slipped past the man working there, and listened at the metal slatted
			 rollup door there.
		-Uh oh. While this is going on, I got some sense that Golden Blade had revealed himself in
		 some manner, his anima flaring.
			-Shit. An immaculate monk soon showed up. Though one who lacks the House mark you'd
			 expect. . .
			-We rushed to them. It would take us two rounds to reach them.
			-Orrr. . . not? Silent Onyx and I arrived at the market, but could only remember what I
			 had felt through the Torc if I really concentrated. Here at the market, it was as if
			 it had never happened. And yet I was still there, for some reason?
				-I could feel similar confusion, through the Torc, from Golden Blade.
				-I vaguely recall Golden Blade dealing the monk a grevious blow. Perhaps this was
				 some power or ploy to escape? If so, it's. . . reach is, at least, somehow limited.
	-In any event, Blade and Libak continued beating the guard officer, that they had / had not
	 been interrupted in doing by that strange monk.
		-Once he dropped, Blade led the freed slaves to the Grand Canal.
		-Golden Blade shouted to them that they were now free, free to do as they will.
		-Libak added that, if they sought jobs, the Suli family could help. Golden Blade spoke up
		 again, shouting that work could be found for warriors at Hawke's compound.
		-Here I spoke up, saying that I don't think it would be wise to lead a crowd back to Hawke's
		 compound. "What happened here is likely to be a big problem for us, and I don't think
		 they'll want that falling on their heads too."
		-They heeded my advice, dispersing the slaves into groups and, and instructing those
		 interested in work with our suggestions to trickle in over time.
	-We then made our own way back to Hawke's compound, only to find the streets nearby deserted,
	 and our way blocked by a figure in a silver mask and white robes, The Emissary.
		-"You are wanted in my city by the armies of Heaven. For this I have cast out others. But I
		  can use you. I have need of you. Come with me."
		-It walked over to the nearest door, and opened it. Inside was not the shop interior one
		 would expect from the exterior, but rather an ornate, marble-clad room, far larger than the
		 building we had walked into.
		-We followed, and, inside, the emmissary removed it's mask, revealing the face of Itraxian,
		 The Weaver.
		-She seemed to know who we were, or were in The First Age, anyways.
		-She asked us for aid in ridding Nexus of the deathknights infesting it.
		-In particular, she asked if we knew of Ophilis Ses, claiming he is somehow the reincarnation
		 of Surin of Justice, another Eclipse Caste from The Invisible Manse.
		-Turning to me, she also said that, "He is working with the ghost of Larquen Quen, that
		 thing that calls itself The Mask of Winters."
		-"I swore long ago that I would not act, except to protect my city and it's ideals. My hand
		  has been forced.
		  I have never been one to employ violence to achieve my ends. I find myself unprepared for the organized force I now face."
		-She looked desperate, and tired.
		-"We can come to an accord," I said, "I am also troubled by The Mask, by the simple fact of
		  his existance, and in more concrete ways.
		-"First," she said, "You must swear an oath, not to reveal who I am."
		-"But how is it that you come to be here?" I asked. "When the others were trapped at The
		  Invisible Manse."
		 "Trapped? We weren't trapped. We were arrogant, too arrogant to admit we feared to leave.
		  After Larquen did that to Meherrin, I could not stay."
		-I was the first to assent to her oath, and each of the others swore it in turn.
		-I asked her then if she had a plan, to eliminate the deathknights in the city.
			-She told us of a Guild factor named Kan Dans, and where to find him.
			-He is a leader among a group known as The Cult of the Illuminated, who believe us to be
			 saviors sent by the gods.
			-The cult is a front. They help Solar Exalts, and eventually smuggle them out of the
			 city, most North, some South. Kan Dans and others in the cult, though, are actually
			 disguised Sidereals.
		-Silent Onyx then spoke up, volunteering that he knew where two Abyssals were, relaying
		 what we saw at the warehouse.
			-"Strange," Itraxian said, after a moment's concentration, "I can barely see this
			  building. . ."
		-Itraxian offered that she could protect us from the Wyld Hunt. She will issue a proclamation
		 forbidding them and their agents from the city.
			-"It may damage the markets, and the damage could be irreparable if the matter isn't
			  resolved within a couple of days. I don't see any other way, though. . ."


TODO:
	-Go back and grab that box.
		-From Lesley: "The box, upon checking, had 2 water skins filled with blood in them."
	-Maybe bait the remaining deathknights with our captive one.
	-In general, do deathknight research and investigation.
		-Speak with "our" deathknight.
		-Enlist "our" dynast, she being already very interested in the subject.
	-Got some answers to a couple of follow up questions: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/902616110845820948
		"In character, you know next to nothing about sidereal exalted
		 The hearthstone recognized itraxian AFTER the mask came off.
		 Each member of the circle is instantly recognizable"
	-Agenda:
		-Learn about Sidereals, starting with asking Itraxian.
		-Learn about Deathknights.
			-Question ours and enlist our Dragonblood.
		-Reach out to the Illuminated, depending on Sidereal answers.


11/8/21: We meet The Cult of the Illuminated
	-Libak and Pip went to delicately explain our natures to Rishi & Hawke.
		-(They had to miss tonight's session, and are best skilled at social delicacy.)
		-What we're saying:
			-We're Solars.
			-We found a bit more than we admitted at the manse, pieces of our past. . .
			-We're going to be hunting Deathknights on behalf of The Emissary, but the deathknights
			 are also hunting for the one we captured.
	-Meanwhile, we asked further questions of The Emissary / Itraxian.
		-"As we look into the deathknigths, how do we reach you?" Golden Blade asked.
		 "If you call for me under the light of the sun, I will seek you."
		-What are these Sidereals you mentioned?
			-"They are the Chosen of Fate, and the architects of our betrayal.
			  Some among them, though, now work to aid Solars. They do not seek the Deliberative
			  restored, but to shape governance themselves.
			  They do not remember, remember how dangerous we can be. Only the eldest among them
			  could, and I only know of one such."
			 "Oh? And who is that?"
			 "I cannot say."
			 "You are sworn not to?"
			 "No. To say their name is to call the eyes of Heaven.
			  Every time your anima flares, the Sidereals have an opportunity to find you. In Heaven,
			  there is a great loom, woven by spiders. When your anima flares, they can spot you in
			  this web.
			  The cult _does_ help, though. Most solars are taken out of the city, but some are taken
			  beneath. To deep places my eyes cannot see. I've seen nearly a dozen young Solars taken
			  down there, but none have returned to the surface.
			  I have heard that members of this cult have defeated deathknights, in the North, and
			  have attacked The Realm's holdings in The Threshold. They were accompanied by shining
			  warriors in golden armor."
			-"Anything else you would warn us of?" Golden Blade asked her.
			 Her eyes glowed gold, briefly, and then she said, "I see people moving, from the armory
			 in The Little Market. They are moving boxes large enough to store a body in. . . "
			-"Before we go," I said, "you should know of another danger. Are you aware that one of
			  the fae dwells within the Firewander's Wyld Zone."
			 "I am."
			 "It speaks of it's minions eventually sweeping forth, rampaging across the surrouding area."
			 "No, I don't think it will be that dangerous soon, with the chimera chasing them."
			 "The chimera?"
			 "It's strange, it feels like Mithra, but looks nothing like them, and I sensed none of
			  the thoughts I'd associate with them. I have encountered Lunars known to me before,
			  and recognized them, but this, it felt. . . detached. Wild.
			  It has been hunting the fae and it's minions, though it does worry me when it leaves
			  the zone. It sometimes goes to the Nighthammer pool at night, absorbing people. Randomly,
			  from what I can tell."
			 "I have sworn myself it's enemy. I mean to see it dealt with."
			 "Ah, you're the one feeding it?"
			 "_Feeding_ it?"
			 "Yes. Each time it faces your opposition, it grows stronger."
			 "Stronger how?" Golden Blade asked.
			 "As you think of it, those thoughts creep into your dreams. In your dreams, a substance
			  called Gossamer forms, and it is harvesting it."
			 "How do we fight such a thing, then?" Golden Blade asked.
			 "With cold iron weapons. You slay it, as we did the Raksha of old."
			 "Good," I responded, "My plan remains unchanged, then."
	-We then opted to hustle over to the armory we'd heard of. It sounds like something is currently
	 under way there.
	-We took a trolley line, and, while on it, listened to word on the street.
		-No mention of the fight in the slave market.
		-Instead, everyone seemed to be talking about the explosions in The Firewander District.
			-There was mention of a glowing girl, battling a silver-clad ninja in a warehous and
			 spilling out onto the street.
			-Well, more or less the same problem. . . 
	-We passed through The Little Market on the way, and Golden Blade suggested looking into cold
	 iron weapons.
		-Golden Blade located a wholesaler of iron ore who was willing to sell small portions, from
		 which we could at least have cold iron weapons _made_.
		-Asking that merchant, he learned that smiths could be found in the market around us that
		 could handle that forging.
		-After Blade arranged the purchase, Onyx got our attention.
			-"Don't turn around. We're being watched."
			 "The Sidereals?" Blade asked.
			 "No. They're not very subtle."
			-We tried to duck out of sight, weaving between the merchant stalls and darting down
			 alleyways.
			-In the course of it, Blade and I lost sight of Onyx, but we could see we'd not shaken
			 our pursuers.
			-They wore silver turbans, and silver sashes, both around their waste and across their
			 faces.
			-There was a crash behind us, and then, suddenly, Blade's friend Sparrow was at his side.
			 "Sparrow!" Blade shouted, "I thought I told you to stay safe!"
			 "I am safe! My friend is here, but says it _is_ very dangeous out on the street today."
				-Onyx later told us he'd seen someone come to our aid, stabbing upwards at what
				 appeared to be the leader of our pursuers as they ran across the clothes roofing
				 the market, presumably this "friend".
	-We followed Sparrow, who led us to a nearby street that had collapsed into the sewers below.
		-Going to a ladder placed there, he led us into the sewers, which strangely grew _cleaner_
		 as we went deeper.
		-As we went, we saw copies of a flyer scattered about, and, grabbing a largely intact
		 copy, I read through it.
			-See "Hand Written Flyer" in Roll20.
			-Those promises are awfully promising (heh).
		-Eventually, we came to an underground tram station, being used as a kind of homeless
		 camp.
			-Sparrow led us to a kid sitting between kegs of a black powder, firedust. He was
			 pouring it by the handful into smaller jars.
			-"You don't have any fire, do you?" he asked, to which we shook our heads.
			-Sparrow introduced us to the child as "more illuminated ones", which got a wide-eyed
			 response from the kid.
			-"Have you heard the promises of Shen Aru?" the new kid asked. "They speak of the
			  shining ones, come to save us, but who will be weak from the long journey from
			  Heaven, and in need of our help.
			  That's why I'm making bombs.
			  Don't worry. You're safe down here now."
			 "Maybe not," Blade said, "Given what hunts us."
			 "I know what hunts you. I've been hunted too. . ."
		-An adult then approached, and introduced himself as Joseph One-Shoe."
			-"I have watched you for some time," he said. Turning to me, "You were the
			  hardest, always traveling back and forth to that manse of yours. There are
			  better ways to do so, you know."
			 "I'm all ears," I responded, "Though I know of some better ways, better is
			  often. . . flashier, and it's not wise to attract too much attention."
			 "That is exactly why I did not reach out, fearing to draw the attention of 
			  watchful eyes. Looks like that attention came to us anyways," he said, looking
			  hard at Sparrow.
			-"Where is the one called Pip?" he then asked.
			 "With a friend of ours," Golden Blade responded.
			-"That. . . thing that has hunted you has proved more effective at the task
			  than I. Stargazer is with it now." Turning to Golden Blade, "You would like
			  her."
			 "What is that thing?" Blade asked.
			 "I do not know. For a long time, I thought it was one of the Sidereals, but it
			  does not seem to be. It is. . . outside Fate. A mystery. You do seem to
			  accumulate those."
			-"You should train with us," he continued. "You could learn, learn to hide from
			  the eyes of Heaven."
			 "Though you seem to have heard much of us," I said, "We've heard but little of you.
			  Tell us more, about yourselves and your organization."
			 "Walk with me," he responded.
		-We walked some 15 minutes, through various corridors, until we came to a great
		 flowing river of raw sewage.
			-"You must first demonstrate your humility," he said, and then leaped into the
			 river of shit.
			-Wading out towards the center of it, he dove, and then did not surface.
			-Silent Onyx was pretty firm about it now being time to go home, but Golden
			 Blade claimed he'd smelled worse on the battlefield.
			 "After you, then," I said.
			-Blade indeed climbed in. I removed my buff jacket, leaving it folded in the
			 corridor, and waded in after, finally followed by a still protesting Onyx.
			-I will refrain from describing this in the detail that Lesley did.
			-Out towards the center of the flow, we could indeed feel an opening, with a
			 slight suction.
			-Diving down, it led to a lower chamber, draining through a grate there.
			-That chamber featured a great, circular door, and many corpses apparently mauled
			 by some kind of beast.
			-Joseph too stood there, and he was casting a spell, which I recognized as Open
			 the Spirit Door.
		-The passage open, we went inside, finding a place far different from the sewers
		 surrounding it. Inside was a building, surrounded by greenery, though with
		 pipes meeting above, forming a ceiling.
			-At the doorway to the building stood a lion, far larger than a natural one and
			 apparently made of gold.
				-Onyx volunteered that he had heard tales of celestial lions that guarded
				 the gates of Yu-Shan.
			-Joseph walked up to it and knelt, head bowed.
			-Golden Blade walked up to the door, but the lion moved to block his path.
			-Joseph then spoke up. "I suggest you sit, and meditate on your day. We will
			 not be allowed to enter until night fall."
			-I shrugged, and sat, cross-legged, on the ground beside him.
			-With plenty of time (and thus mote regeneration) on hand, I took a moment to
			 look around with Spirit-Detecting Glance, this being a spirit's sanctum and all.
				-We were indeed surround by dematerialized spirits, _stray cat_ spirits,
				 and, in fact, now that you looked close, several actual stray cats, lounging
				 in the area.
		-After some time there, others emerged from the portal behind us, first another child, then
		 "our" deathknight, garbed as one of Rishi's servants, Libak, and Pip.
			-We greeted the others, asking how they came to be here, while the child simply went
			 up to where Joseph was and knelt beside him.
			-Libak simply said, "We were attacked by deathknights. She has her heart back. The
			 Mask of Winters is on his way." (!!!)
			 "What?!?" I asked, "What happened?"
			 "Rishi was having a party. Talking with him, it seemed he already knew what we were.
			  You received the same invitation as us, and were then led down here, through a river
			  of shit?"
			 "Our invitation came with enemies on our heels," I replied. "The shit was the same,
			  though."
		-We had no further time for discussion, though, as the door opened, and the lion moved aside.
			-Joseph and the latest child immediately walked forward, into a courtyard, and began 
			 washing in a fountain there.
			-I hurried forward to join them in it.
			-My face at least clean, a moment later, I finally looked up, to see us surrounded by
			 many more cats, spirits and mortal, and two other dematerialized spirits, a great gorilla
			 seemingly made of stone and covered in street-filth, and a demon, a nude figure with
			 rusty iron needles emerging from it's back.
			-After we all finished washing, the spirit then materialized.
			-Joseph approached it, and said, "Honored sewer lord, I have brought new initiates."
			 "Are you sure? They seem headstrong."
			 "I'm sure, I'm sure."
			 "I'll leave the decision to my wife."
			 A large cat spirit then appeared, walking up to us and sniffing each in turn. After the
			 last of us, she walked off again.
			 "Excellent. It's decided. Welcome to the underground sanctuary!"
			 "Is there another way here," Libak asked, "Other than through the shit?"
			 "Through the shit, every time," Joseph responded.
			 "What is this place?" Libak then asked.
			 "It is a place of training," Joseph replied. "Come! Follow me. You must be famished."
		-Well, maybe not hungry, but we followed him nonetheless. He led us into a room off the
		 courtyard, where several people sat drinking sake around a couple of tables.
			-Joseph called over to a man serving as bartender, calling for drinks for all of us.
				-I mumbled, "Yes, yes," to my stirring bottle bug, and then said louder, "Yes,
				 I'll have one."
			-The man brought over several chiped and worn cups, with more of the sake.
			-We toasted, "To new friends."
			-The sake was thick, and bad, but burned like strong booze.
			-After a couple of sips, Joseph spoke again, saying, "So, tell us about yourselves."
			-Blade and I both talked over each other, saying much the same thing, that we had followed
			 him down here after asking _him_ about _himself_.
			 "Ah. Yes, very well. I am the leader of this sanctuary. I helped build it, and wish to
			  help welcome you to it."
			 "You look so young," Golden Blade commented.
			 "Thank you. You flatter a man."
			 "What's you're secret?"
			-At that, his eyes flashed, briefly, with yellow stars, and he smiled.
				-He reminded me of a man in red I once met, though the memory now seemed strangely
				 faint, for something that happened less than a year ago, if I have the details right.
			-A man at the table we sat at, blond and dressed in rags, also flashed an Eclipse caste
			 mark. A woman, then, flashed a Twilight mark, and the other man at the table, a Night
			 Caste mark.
				-After a moments hesitation, we all responded in kind.
				-"Our" deathknight then too showed a caste mark, a suddenly bleeding gash, in the
				 shape of a Dawn Caste mark, to looks of shock from the cultists.
				-The blonde man, then, introduced himself as Nissen. "These are my fellows, Aslag
				 and The Heartless," he said, gesturing first to the woman and then to the man.
				-Joseph mentioned that Aslag knew quite a bit about artifacts and their creation.
				-"What brought you here?" Libak asked them.
				 Nissen spoke, saying, "We, like you, are illuminated. Joseph found me first.
				  I oversee things here, look after everyone."
				 Joseph: "Speaking of, where's Nylia? She's supposed to be here."
				 Nissen: "I told her. But she must still be with the others."
				-Joseph, looking to us: "These are the ones who have remembered traces of their
				  past lives."
				 Nissen: "You too remember fragments?"
				 I acknowledged that we do.
				 Heartless: "I remember my death. There was a great dinner, and then great
				              explosions."
					-Golden Blade seemed to start at this.
				 Aslag: "I remember my child screaming. They killed her first, and then me. . ."
				 Nissen: "I heard word of the attacks. I hid, and helped them kill the rest of my
				          circle, sending the betrayers their way, in a vain attempt to save myself."
				 Joseph: "Before I reincarnated, I believed wrongly. I helped them in their usurpation,
						  and killed several Solars.
						  We are here, working together, to build a better world."
				 I: ". . . I do wish for the same. We have lost so much."
				 Joseph: "You should stay with us, learn here. There is much we can teach you."
				-He was pressing the issue quite hard, seemingly leaning especially hard on the
				 _staying here_ part.
				-There was much there that was attractive to me, the knowledge and allies we could
				 gain, but. . . we cannot _always_ remain here. We all have responsibilities outside
				 this sanctuary, ones which face dire threats..
				-I voiced those concerns, saying, "But how long can we safely stay here? Grave forces
				  on the move above, and not just us but many innocents are in great danger."
				 Libak: "Yes, we have responsibilities, families."
				 Joseph: "No one said forever. Your families, though, are in more danger with you
				          present. Pip's mother has just lost her home, and you all draw the threats
						  down on those you seek to protect.
				 Libak: "We also have artifacts. . . Ones dangerous to investigate with so many Solars
						 around.
				-I wish he was sitting close enough I could kick him.
				 Joseph: "Oh? What do you mean?"
				 Libak: ". . . it's a long story. We. . . it can. . ."
				-Golden Blade broke in, asking, "How big is this place?"
				 Joseph: "It is quite vast, and we also control the sewer system.
				 Golden Blade: "What do you mean, stay here? In. . ."
				 Joseph: ". . .Sanctuary."
				 Onyx: "We've got shit to do! We can't stay here."
				 Joseph: "What is it you need to do?"
				 Onyx: "None of your business!"
				 Heartless: "You shouldn't be so rude. Perhaps we can help? What have you been up to?"
				-At that, Onyx squirmed, and eventually said, "There's a bunch of deathknights above."
				 Heartless: "Deathknights we can certainly help with."
				 Joseph: "Let us prove ourselves to you. We can make a deal. We'll help you with
				          this, and you'll train with us."
				 I: "That would be a great good, helping us and countless more."
			    -After this, another woman walked into the room. Joseph asked her where she had been,
				 and she said that, "I was with the new recruits. I had to teach them something about
				  demons. They thought they could be friends. . .
			      Ah, but so many new faces. I am Nylia."
			    -We each introduced ourselves.
				-She recognized Golden Blade's name, and asked him if it was true he'd fought a
				 deathknight at Thorns, to which he nodded.
				 "You were young to have done such a thing. I'm impressed.
				  Well, I imagine they've been beating you all over the heads with this? They have
				  no subtlety. . .
				  You may relax. Your outside concerns need not worry you here.
				  We have been helping you somewhat already, watching over Pip's mom, and, Libak, we were sorry to hear about your brother. We have been looking for him."
				-She also said to Libak that his cheekbones indeed marked him as a Suli.
				-In a quick back and forth, she also said something to Onyx about how they'd been
				 "writing to his family for him," after he made an allusion to what his family thinks
				 of him. She said that they think he's up to something respectable, and even are
				 quite proud of him.
					-Well that's all kinds of creepy.
				-The deathknight then spoke up, saying, "What about me?"
				 Libak: "We can help with your blood thing. If you want. You don't have to. Of
				         course, there are also the other deathknights, looking for you.
				 "_Other_ deathknights?" Nylia chimed in, stepping towards The Mistress.
				 Nylia: "I sense in you the soul of an Illuminated one. We can offer you protection
				         here."
				-Her words rang with great passion. She _really_ believed in this.
				-Joseph: "We will not force you to remain here. We can make a deal. We will help you,
						  you will see us for who we are, and you will come train here."
				-That was met with fists pounding the table from his fellows, and calls for another
				 round from Joseph.
				 I: "I can agree, to round and help both. There's so much we can help one another
				     with, so much we can do for all of Creation. . ."
				-Heartless, getting up to leave: "I will alert the Shi-Tai."
				 Joseph: "The Shi-Tai will be able to help you. They fight our enemies.
						 "You have already met their leader, Black Powder Jack. He makes bombs for us."
				 Blade: "I remember. Bit unnerving seeing a child making bombs."
				 Joseph: "Don't let his age fool you. There's no better bombmaker. Though, like all
				          kids, he sometimes has questionable judgment. . ."
				-Nylia then got up, and said, "Come. You should meet the others."
				-I downed my glass and followed.
				-We walked out into the courtyard, and she called out, "Everyone! Come meet the new
				 ones!"
				-A large crowd quickly gathered, from various doors.
					-Most looked like vagrants.
				-A woman also came from the direction of the entrance, soon washing herself in the
				 fountain. She was walking with a limp, and the water in the fountain was soon bloody.
				-Libak seeing this, called out, "Does anyone here know medicine?"
				-Aslag called out that she was a doctor, so he asked that she, the injured woman, and
				 me (?) to come over to the room with the table.
					-There, he retrieved the Wound-Mending Needles from the Cache Egg, handing them
					 to Aslag and instructing her in their use.
					-While she was busy with that, Libak pulled me aside, asked about asking Aslag
					 for help with mirror, Joseph having mentioned her facility with artifacts, but
					 I advised caution. We did not yet know these people.
					-The artifact did wonders for the woman, who we learned was indeed Stargazer.
				-Meanwhile, we began to see tracers. Colors seemed brighter, and sound clearer.
				-Returning to the courtyard, the crowd had begun scattering seeds and powders in one
				 portion of it, which they then set on fire.
				-Nylia: "We have new friends, and their need is great. We will help them!"
				-While I was in the room, Jack had joined us, and, stepping away from the fountain, 
				 he spoke to us, saying, "As leader of the Shi-Tai, I pledge you our protection."
					-As he spoke, a Twilight Caste mark shown forth from his forehead.
				-Another woman walk forward, illuminating a Night Caste mark as she did, saying,
				 "I am Jasara, leader of the Kyodai of The Underground Sanctuary. Many call me wise.
				  I will ensure you are fed and clothed.
				  I know we have not yet met, but I feel a kinship with you. You came from low
				  places, and are meant for great things."
				-Stargazer too now came forward, formallying introducing herself. She said, "I am
				  called Stargazer. I have sacrificed my honor, because I never had any. Now I need
				  none, for I have them. I do what their precious hands cannot, strike down those
				  who would harm us.
				  They are my family, and they have accepted you. I will protect you."
				-A young girl then walked out, looking at each of us at turn, and finally at Onyx.
				 She spoke to him, saying, "I don't think you remember me, but I forgive you for
				  leaving me there."
					-Onyx looked thoughtful, and then a bit shocked, muttering something about Hilo's
					 Keep. . .
				-She then looked down, suppressed a sniffle, and walked away.
				-As they were talking, the tracers began to intensify. As incense burned around us,
				 Nylia said a prayer to The Unconquered Sun, and spoke of how we were his chosen. It
				 was an impressive and moving performance.
				-It got pretty intense, and some of the. . . heartier adults of the crowd began to
				 scourge themselves with lengths of beaded and braided hair, as Nylia said, "Cleanse
				 your flesh of your sins, that your spirit may be free."
				-As she spoke, the crowd repeated it, amplifying her voice.
		-After the ceremony, the crowd more or less all headed towards the bar.
			-Silent Onyx, in response to entreaties to, "Come! Have another drink!" refused said,
			 "No. No more. You drugged us."
			-Nylia interjected, naming it, "Bright Morning", a part of their rituals.
				-I indeed knew it, and similar hullucinagenic drugs are a common component of
				 sorcerous initiations and many shamanic rituals.
			-I quite enthusiastically joined in, at a table inside the bar.
				-Though I was drinking without getting drunk. I eventually did get a bit of a stomach
				 ache, as the bug began to stir more.
				-Actually, no one in the crowd seemed very drunk, but they do seem to be feeling
				 _something_.
				-I spent quite a bit of time talking with them about their theology.
					-Most of their beliefs are derived from The Promises.
					-They also a concept of "personal illumination".
						-Pressed on it, they described taking _immense_ quantities of Bright
						 Morning, as Shen Aru had done (not strictly necessary, but the most common
						 option, as it's traditional), while self-flagellating and otherwise self-
						 depriving. They then write down what they see, sharing it with others of
						 the cult, and try to repeat various methods reputed to yield good results.
			-Much of the cult seemed to have been rather down-and-out before they Exalted.
			-Through out all of this, they have been painfully frank and honest about themselves,
			 and other hard subjects.
				-I knew many of my circle could identify lies with Charms, and from their quite
				 evident skepticism, I imagine they tried, but no one ever reported anything.
			-A common thread in their beliefs is that the current system isn't working, and that
			 The Illuminated are here to cast it down and rebuild it.
			-They don't seem to be in full agreement about what to rebuild, ranging from anarchists,
			 to technocrats, some believing in the supremacy of the Illuminated, or others in that
			 they are here to serve and protect humanity.
			-They do, though, all seem united in the belief that it was through _humanity_, not the
			 Terrestrial Exalted, that Creation has endured through this Age of Sorrows.
			-To Golden Blade's especial delight, they're definitely against slavery.


TODO:
	-Speak more with our _now released_ deathknight, ideally out of earshot from the cult.
	-Ask Joseph to tell me what he knows of my home, my manse.
		-"Every truth you speak unbinds my tongue in turn. I'm sure you understand what it is to
		  have necessary secrets."
		-Making introductions between them and your monks could benefit both groups, allowing them
		 to exchange knowledge, even while you're busy.
		-Posted about it and got a response here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/912146162373509141
			-He knows the monastery exists, and it's _general_ location, enough to enable some
			 collaboration, since the existance of your followers has already been revealed to him.
	-Rereading the above notes, Joseph had offered to help us "learn to hide from the eyes of Heaven".
		-_That_ would be quite the prize, if what Itraxian told us is true. Might explain why they're
		 so intent on keeping us down there too. Makes his offer more attractive.


11/22/21:
	-I had my discussion with Joseph One-Shoe, from the TODO above, while we drank after the
	 ceremony.
	-We also found a moment to corner Libak and Pip, and learned a bit more about The Mistress of
	 Pacts Sealed in Blood's new freedom.
		-Libak, apparently, was unable to bear watching her suffer, enslaved, any longer, and
		 released her himself.
		-Thankfully, he wasn't _completely_ idiotic about it.
			-He extracted promises of no retaliation, sanctified by Pip's Eclipse caste ability.
			-She, meanwhile, claims to be intent on escaping The Mask of Winters, and wishes to
			 somehow undo what was done to her, her twisted Exaltation.
				-Well, that's eminently compatible with what you, and the rest of the circle, seek.
				-If we can indeed trust her, we still may have an ally here.
				-I owe her an apology, I think. Though, with my compassion vs. conviction, it's
				 probably going to be one tainted with rationalization and justifications.
	-Nissen, Black Powder Jack, and Jasara the Wise are the ones among the cult who champion most
	 strongly the three broad strains of New Age the various members seek.
		-Nissen envisions an age of anarchy, where all are equal.
		-Jasara is essentially an anarcho-capitalist, though she believes it will somehow be filled
		 with individual operators, and has various ideas how to prevent guilds from dominating.
		-Black Powder Jack is more or less an anarcho-communist, with some vague, hand-wavy notions
		 as to how they'll maintain important freedoms.
		-All, though, believe that the Solars are not meant to _lead_, but to enact the will of
		 humanity.
	-Another circle of Solars among the cult seemed very interested
		-Aslag, who we met earlier, seeks to eliminate resource scarcity in Creation, and has ideas
		 as to how.
		-Kismet, an Eclipse Caste artificer, is interested in AI, and who seeks to rebuild the
		 (instant) messaging system of The Old realm.
		-Kouf Thengi, of the Dawn Caste, seeks a new defensive grid, or access to the Realm's.
	-In talking with that circle, I mentioned that I did indeed remember some of the created
	 intelligences of The First Age.
		-The whole crowd reacted to that with silence, shocked looks on their faces.
			-Those we'd just been introduced to as one's who remembered portions of their past lives
			 feigned shock too! Hmm. . .
		-Joseph then stepped in, saying, "Our friend must be confused. I'm sure you all remember the
		 first time you had Bright Morning. . ."
		-Rylea, too, spoke to the crowd, and seemed to be doing something with essence as she did,
		 calming the onlookers as she said, "Yes, you all know how the Bright Morning affects you."
		-Golden Blade, despite me quickly kicking him as he spoke up, insisted she was lying, that
		 these _were_ memories.
		-Joseph then stepped back in, acknowledging that, "Yes. It's true. I have heard that some
		 remember. Remember a better world, better with you in it. One where the Solars brought about
		 wonders."
			-With the last, he looked at me, and I responded, "That's so. We've lost so much. It's
			 restoration is my fondest dream."
			-After I spoke, though, one of the children seemed to get angrier and angrier, eventually
			 storming off, red-faced.
				-Golden Blade asked Sparrow about him, but he didn't know what the deal was.
				-Rylea chimed in, though saying, "He has had. . . dreams. He believes he did
				 terrible things, committed atrocities."
				-Golden Blade: "I remember instead terrible things done _to_ me. We're not judged
								for the sins of past lives. There's no sense in it!"
				-Me: "We are given great power. But that does not mean we cannot fail. . ."
				-Joseph then spoke up, saying, "I would not have gathered you all here if I thought
				  you were monsters."
					-Of course, but Golden Blade frowned at this, and asked what he meant.
					 Joseph: "I do not think you are the monster the Immaculate Faith claims you
					          are."
					 Golden Blade: "Obviously not. But, some we call monsters, they simply hunt.
									Could we not easily be counted among such forces of nature?"
					 Joseph: "I have met demons, it's true. But I have not met one of your kind who
							  behaved like one."
					-At this, Blade frowned further.
				-Rylea, filled with faith, joined in, saying, "We are Illuminated. We cannot do evil."
					-Pip said that, "I certainly know that is not true."
					-The more effective retort, though, was The Mistress's, as she began to laugh,
					 and all eyes turned towards her.
					 "I've known a Solar worse than The Mask of Winters," she said, "Havesh, called
					  The Vanisher. He will kill people, and then take their form, and their lives,
					  for a week or two. Drinking their wine, fucking their wives, all while disposing
					  of their bodies, piece by piece, around the area.
					 Golden Blade: "That's still not a page on The Mask of Winters."
					 Mistress: "The Mask does what he does beceause he believes he must, that it is
					            the only way to restore order to this world, before it falls into
								oblivion.
								Havesh does what he does because he enjoys it."
					 Blade: "But none among us here is like that."
					-Stargazer reacted to that last a bit, looking away.
						-Never one to resist butting in, Blade asked her why she had that look on her face.
						-"Why are you acting the inquisition here?" she retorted. "You ask to many questions."
						 Blade: "You ask too few! Why are you so willing to accept us as gods?"
						 Stargazer: "Gods?!? You're barely Exalted! I don't know why we're wasting our time on such trash."
						 Blade: "Barely Exalted?!? Care to test that?"
						-Heartless stepped in here, before they came to blows, saying, "That's an 
						  interesting idea. But I don't think we should be fighting one another.
						  Perhaps another test. A hunt. . .
						  You wish to rid the city of deathknights? Well, we do too."
						-Here, he glared at The Mistress.
						-Heartless: "I have been working with my agents, and have identified the
						             location of two deathknights in the city, and we, or Joseph,
									 at least, wish for you to train here."
									 I propose a contest, the first to return with one of their heads
									 will have proven themselves. If Stargazer is first, you'll train
									 with us."
						-The Mistress here spoke up, saying "I also have a question. Would you count
						  me among their circle?"
						 Turning to us, she asked, "Would _you_?"
							-Golden Blade: "How could we possibly trust you?"
							-Me: "I suppose I owe you an apology, for contuing your captivity, and
							      for not investigating as quickly as I might have whether it could
								  be ended. Perhaps I owe you this olive branch. . ."
							-Mistress: "I'll be honest. Had you freed me when you first claimed my
									    heart, I would have tried to kill you.
										It is only after the chance to reflect that my captivity gave,
										a time that was perhaps the greatest kindness done to me in
										my life, that I could see another path. I'd seen another life,
										one better than any I'd had."
							-Turning then to Libak, she said, "And one of you gave me a chance. . ."
							 Her face turning red, she continued, "And you may be the closest thing
							  to friends I've ever had
							-That. . . does not say good things about her life thus far, if that's
							 her opinion of treatment even _I_ feel a bit bad about.
							-Blade turned to the rest of the circle, saying, "Well, what do the rest
							  of you think?"
							 Onyx: "I still think the best thing to do would be to sell her."
							 Mistress, to Onyx: "I admit I'm still struggling with the not wanting
							                     to kill _you_."
						-Blade then raised the matter at hand, the matter of his pride, saying,
						 "Well, why not have a competition?"
						 Me: "It's foolish, to risk, in haste, botching such a dangerous hunt."
						 Stargazer: "You sound like a bitch. That sounds like fear."
						-Heartless stepped in, saying, "Forgive her, she. . ."
						-Stargazer cut him off, though, with, "Forgive this!" and a gesture.
						-Rylea: "Please, this is senseless."
						 Stargazer: "You sound like a bitch too."
						-At this point, Blade, Pip, and I were all stepping towards her, raising
						 fists, while one of Stargazer's circlemates tried to talk her down, shrugging
						 at the lack of success.
						-The Mistress apparently borrowed Blade's cloak, as he doffed it, and she
						 did. . . something, some necromantic spell. Her caste mark glowed red, and
						 she seemed to instantly attune to the cloak.
						-After only a second or two of trying the cloak-now-bat-wings's motions, she
						 then lunged at Stargazer, and battle was joined.
						-Their fight was brutal, and escalatingly lethal, until The Mistress
						 ultimately triumphed, dumping a bitten-by-a-charm-enhanced-maw Stargazer at
						 Aslag's feet, saying, "This trash needs patching up. I don't care about your
						  bet, but if she talks to us like that again, all of you are next."
				-My ire was spent, having witnessed the savage beating of it's target, so I went to
				 Libak, suggesting he again provide Aslag with the needles..
				-Presenting them to her, Libak also apologized to Joseph for the mess.
				-"No," Joseph said, "All need humbling at times. Your pride can be your undoing."
				-Joseph then turned to the crowd, announcing, "The deathknights are now our first
				 priority. Lets get to work."
				-Turning to us, he said, "You have not trained with us, and do not know our ways. We
				  usually send circles as strike teams, or send Heartless if stealth is needed.
				  I ask two things of you: don't reveal yourselves and, whenever possible, work through mortals."
				-I agreed that was wisdom.
	-We discussed our mortal ties, who we could work through.
		-Joseph reminded us of our ties to Hawke's mercenaries.
		-He then pulled out a sheet of paper and a brush, and then, so quickly it was clearly charm-
		 enhanced, he drew up a contract, addressed to Hawke, promising three silver talons for the
		 destruction of one of the deathknights' factories.
		-The mark on the contract, though, was The Emissary's.
			-We glanced at each other, and shrugged. The Emissary won't likely mind a forged note
			 advancing her business anyways.
			-Joseph misinterpretted our looks, and said, "It's best for the city that an existing
			  source of stability is reinforced."
	-"OK!" Joseph called out to the others, "We've trained for this! We're at war."
		-The various groups then hurried off, mobilizing.
	-Black Powder Jack ran up to us, offering Blade an iron sphere two hands across, saying, "Here,
	 use this if you get into trouble!"
		-Pip: "What's in this?"
		 Jack: "Enough steel and powder to level a large building."
	-We then wound our way back up the labyrinthine path to the surface, and made our way back to
	 Hawke's.
		-During the trip back, The Mistress seemed to shy away from the sun, flinching at it's touch.
		-I asked her about this, saying, "Are you all right?"
		 Mistress: "It burns me, the light."
		 I: "Has this always been so? Since your. . . Exaltation?"
		 Mistress: "No, it has never been this bad."
		 I: "Well, lets hurry, then, and get you inside."
		-Once back at the compound, Hawke's troops allowed us back inside.
		-As we walked down a hallway, though, The Mistress suddenly pounced like a cat, on something
		 in the corner.
			-Standing back up, her mouth was bloody, and she clutched half a rat in hand.
			-She quickly devoured the other half, and looked relieved, saying, "I have not tasted
			 blood in a long time. When I bit into that bitch, it awoke something in me. . ."
			-Turning, we saw one of Hawke's men, looking on in horror.
			-"It's my ghost-blooded ancestory," The Mistress lied.
			-I shoved Libak towards the man, to smooth things over, and pushed the rest down the hall.
		-We got to Hawke's office, finding him there, asleep on his couch, while Talsin, his
		 Lieutenant, did paperwork at the desk.
			-We told Talsin we brought business, new work in the city.
			-"You know," he said, "The Emissary will not allow us to move an army through the city."
			 "But this work is _for_ The Emissary," Blade too enthusiastically volunteered, offering
			 up the contract..
				-He also slipped, and referred to her as _her_, a point Hawke later questioned, but
				 Blade mumbled something about ships and cities always being women.
			-Talsin's eyes widened, and she said, "Let me see that."
			-After reading it, and carefully examining the seal, she walked over to the couch and
			 kicked Hawke in the ribs, yelling, "Wake up you drunken fool! We've got work."
			-Looking over the contract, and then nodding, Hawke set Talsin to work, and then,
			 looking to us, said, "This is cause for celebration. Have a drink with me."
			-Hawke asked us to close the door. When Pip did so, he was suddenly more serious, saying,
			 "Once we move troops through Nexus, without The Emissary stopping us, this city will
			  plunge into chaos.
			  But, we all must die one day! And there _is_ much opportunity here."
			-"Have you read the contract?" Hawke then asked, "It instructs us to raze a large area
			  of the city, near the docks, and offers us control over any portion of that area that
			  we then rebuild."
				-Looking at it, the area in question is that factory and it's surroundings.
				-That. . . does not exactly match what Joseph told us. . .
			-Hawke was game, though, and began to see to preparations.
				-He kept a drink clutched in one hand, though we now rarely saw him drink from it.
		-When we got a moment alone, there was much finger pointing.
			-I, and Onyx too, were none too happy about Blade's willingness to claim to Hawke that
			 this was indeed The Emissary's work, and to plow on once Hawke pointed out the contents.
			-He, meanwhile, asked where these objections were beforehand, with me then yelling about
			 him leaving no time for such before he opened his mouth and put his foot in it.
			-Amidst this, though, we resolved to at least share events with The Emissary while we
			 still had a bit of daylight left.
				-We found a secluded spot in the courtyard, and Pip held the contract to the sky,
				 calling to The Emissary, and mumbling through an explanation.
				-Our response was cryptic, more than a bit ominous, but not a firm no.
					-A snake skin grew from the contract, containing a perfect replica of it, and
					 the contract itself then turned into a snake, attempting to bite Pip until she
					 cast it away.
	-As night fell, the city burned.
		-We could see fires springing up in various areas, mostly in the Nexus Pool district.
		-As we moved through the city, towards the factory, we could see gangs moving through the
		 city.
			-Many were led by what Pip named members of the "hatchet gang" that had harassed her
			 mother.
			-Others were led by snakemen, but all groups were seen looting and burning.
			-As we moved into the Nexus Pool district, we began to see knots of resistance, led by
			 martial artists dressed as monks, protecting various buildings.
				-I think I saw some like them among the cultists?
		-Along our path, rising above the building, we saw the flare of some dark anima.
			-Rounding a corner, I saw a familiar face, the deathknight who had visited my manse with
			 one of the Larquen clones.
			-I mumbled through a mantra, the activation phrases for my suspended spells, my skin
			 turning to brass and my hands twisting into claws.
			-I called, then, to my comrades, saying, "Careful! This one is quick!" and then ran at
			 the woman, swiping at her with one of my clawed hands.
			-The claw scraped across her armor, but found at least one chink, as blood began to drip.
			-"We meet again!" I called to her. "You left too soon, last time. . ."
			-Any response she might have had was cut off as Pip hurled a ball of fire at the wall of
			 the dead end at her back.
				-It exploded in a burst of flame, burning the woman and knocking her down.
				-Asking her later what that was, she said she'd loosed a spell from her cord, Flight
				 of the Brilliant Raptor.
			-Onyx then joined the fight, leaping towards a wall and then pushing back off it towards
			 her, blade first.
			-His strike was then compounded by unlooked for help, a molotov cocktail hurled from the
			 a roof above, splashing the deathknight with flaming liquid.
			-Our own deathknight was not to be out done. Taking wing with the cloak, she soared up,
			 then flew back down at her erstwhile comrade, slashing at her with the razor-tipped wings.
			-Armored Golden Blade rushed forward, but was slow to reach her.
			-We could here the shouting voices of a crowd, somewhere South of us. Voices raised in
			 anger, perhaps another of the mobs of looters.
			-She, though greviously wounded, seemed to very much be enjoying this, and lunged towards
			 me with an obviously charm-enhanced flurry of blows.
				-The force of them would have sufficed to slay even great warriors, even me with my
				 bronze skin, were it not for the Invisble Manse's hearthstone.
			-Thankfully, before she could add to those, Onyx struck again, severing her head from
			 her neck.
			-I then took stock of the situation, looking for both escape and the mob we'd heard.
			-Instead, noise on the roof above called my eyes upward, and there I saw a dreadful sight.
			 There stood another of the Larquen clones, holding a cage of Soulsteel nearly large
			 enough for a person, within which there was a roiling ball of some black essence.
			-I called out that there was another foe above, and then ran up a convenient series of
			 crates nearby, taking myself up and over the roofs, towards the Larquen clone.
			-It looked down at us, as golden metal flowed over it. Another of the symbiotes. 
			-As she looked up to the figure on the roof, a look of fear crossed her face, swiftly
			 turning to rage. She flew up, and attempted to strike the clone. Before her wings could
			 cut him, quick as a snake, he counterattacked with his blade, and she fell, crumpling at
			 his feet, unmoving and bleeding. . .
			-Onyx rushed up to the roofs himself, also attempting to strike the clone, but again the
			 clone struck him quicker. This time, though, it merely shoved Onyx back, saying, "Stand
			  back, boy. I have no quarrel with you."
			 "You called me boy. We do have a quarrel."
			 "Then die."
			-Pip then called out, saying, "Wait! I've got a plan, a spell! It requires your
			 cooperation!" She then untied a knot in her spell-cord, releasing. . . something.
			 Golden Blade and I were then drawn towards her, _merging_ with her. Silent Onyx,
			 though, apparently resisted.
			-The resulting being stood nearly ten feet tall, and was ferociously powerful.
			-I (we?) willed it forward, running a few strides and then leaping up onto the rooftop,
			 beside the clone. Strong with the power of our various charms, artifacts, and techniques,
			 I/we dismembered the clone, slashing at it with our blade ten times in the blink of an
			 eye.
				-One more clone left, then.
			-As the adrenaline of battle slowly faded, so too did all three of us walk forth from
			 the composite that we had been.
			-I immediately ran to the fallen Mistress, and began to open the front of my buff jacket,
			 mumbling. That earned me several quizzical looks, looks that soon turned to horror as
			 I bared the skin of my stomach and the bottlebug crawled forth from it.
				-It skittered across the roof to The Mistress, diving into her, and setting about
				 mending her wounds, visible then only when it peeked out, or when its legs reached
				 out around a wound, to pull it closed.
				-This required a fair bit of explaining to my companions, that no, we don't need to
				 kill it, and that it's under my control and healing her.
					-All managed without mentioning the word demon too.
			-Silent Onyx wasn't paying much attention to that, though, as, with the clone's death,
			 its symbiote was now pursuing a distressed, but much faster, Onyx.
				-I set about offering what quick explanations I could, getting across that it was a
				 thing of value, a weapon, but that it also possessed it's hazards.
				-We tried to work out some way of containing it, with it punching it's way through
				 a crate we tried, ultimately settling on the cache egg.
					-That may complicate retrieving things from there in the future, but not in an
					 _especially_ dangerous way.
	-That battle marked the most dangerous part of the night. The rest of the evening, we helped
	 Hawke's men clear the rest of the area.
		-The chaos was great, with fires and marauding gangs tearing through the district.
		-Zombies were also seen throughout the area.
		-Hawke's men had aid, though. Many times, we rushed to an area, only to find the problem
		 already solved by groups of cultists working with Hawke's soldiers.
			-In private moments of conversation with them, they chastized us for the flared
			 combo-anima that had been visible over the city, but you could still tell they were
			 also impressed.
			-Jack, though, is wowed. He has studied magic, and seen it done, but has _never_ seen
			 anything like what Pip did.
		-As things calmed, Hawke's men demolished a few damaged building, and secured several
		 important areas of the waterfront there, settling in.
		-The cult too took the opportunity to go on the offensive. If Hawke now controls the portion
		 of the district we'd attacked, the cult now controls the rest of the Nexus Pool district.
		-The Emissary was also seen above the city, flitting two and fro in the blink of an eye.
		 Where ever she (it!) paused, the fires below ceased, or gangs and rioters were swept up,
		 seemingly as if by wind, and dumped into the canals.
		-Towards the end of the night, runners brough a message to each of us, bearing The Emissary's
		 seal, saying simply, "Two more days."
	-The Mistress made it, thankfully, and when she awoke, she was even able to tell us something
	 about the Soulsteel cage we'd claimed.
		-She said it is a Celestial Monstrance, containing one or more Abyssal Exaltations (!).
		-The Neverborn and their servants, she said, hold a lot more control over where the
		 Exaltations go than is the case for other kinds.
	-As dawn broke, the city was calmer, if scarred.
		-Hawke sent a runner to bring us to him, and we came upon him and Rishi drinking wine in a
		 cleared lot, workmen already raising a foundation.
		-All felt the night had gone well, with congratulations due all around.
	-That morning, though, the first signs of sickness began to show.
		-People fell ill, turning green as bulbous growths grew about their necks.
		-All of us recognized the signs: The Great Contagion.
		-As Hawke turned to give an order, we could see buboes on his neck too. . .


TODO:
	-Do you need healing?
		-Yeah, but the wound mending needles should sort it quickly.


12/6/21:
	-While we were waiting to get started, I learned a bit more from Lesley about the laboratory in
	 the monastery's basement.
		-There are 500 clone tanks, 150 of which remain occupied.
		-_Each_ tank had a symbiote, so you retain 497.
	-We began the session back at Hawke's compound.
		-Scouts were still steadily reporting back in.
		-All of our target areas appear to have been hit, by Hawke's men or the cultists.
		-Most of the fighting ended up limited to the Nexus district, with some happening
		 around the Nighthammer district's arsenal as well.
		-We also heard more signs of The Great Contagion, not seen since the dawning of The Age of
		 Sorrows.
			-Also some weirdness that _may_ just be that, around the Nexus coliseum.
				-Reports talked of monsters as well as illness, though the former may simply be
				 fever dreams.
	-We adjourned for a bit back to Golden Blade's room, to use the Wound-Mending Needles to heal
	 (most of) my wounds.
	-Golden Blade suggested isolating Hawke, to prevent the spread of sickness.
		-As he stepped out into hall, though, there was already a runner lying, feverish, on the
		 floor of the hallways.
		-We dragged those we found, Hawke included, to a room, isolating them a bit.
	-We resolved to see to matters at the coliseum, as monsters may be a direly urgent matter, and
	 then to see what we could do about the disease outbreak.
		-Our Panacea Pipe has great promise, but we need to learn more to use it.
		-Pip (not here for the session) volunteered to stay behind and tend to the ill among the
		 mercenaries.
	-As we stepped out of the compound, there was some faint. . . noise, in the air.
		-Listening closely, it sounded like discordant piping, and whisper. Whispers like we've
		 heard since our exposure to the black mirror. . .
		-It came from the direction of the coliseum. I guess our course was clear.
	-We comandeered an empty canal boat, though Golden Blade promptly smashed it into another.
	-Comandeering a unsmashed third, we lifted it's unconscious and shivering owner from it, Blade
	 tucking some money into the man's pocket.
	-This time, Blade had more success poling it along.
	-Soon, as we passed beneath a bridge, we saw a still running trolly going overhead. Knowing it
	 ran towards the coliseum, we all lept up to the bridge above, and climbed aboard it.
		-It was still full of passengers, all unconscious and feverish. This works quick. . .
		-As the automated cable car made it's stops, we unloaded them, reasoning we did not need to
		 bring them closer to harm.
		-Indeed, as we got closer to the arena, not only did the sound grow louder, but people on the
		 street seemed to be sicker, many now lying clearly dead.
	-As we got off the trolly at it it's terminous, the cacaphony had grown loud, and even rats
	 seemed to have fallen sick the moment they crawled up onto the street.
		-This close, I could also no longer feel the prayers of my cult, drowned out in the noise.
	-The arena's gates were clogged with bodies, what seemed to be the remnants of a crowd trying
	 to escape.
		-It would prove necessary to climb the coliseum's walls to enter.
		-Blade and I powered up, while Onyx scouted ahead, scaling the walls.
		-He was soon back, reporting what he saw.
			-Inside the arena, there was a pack of zombie-looking dogs, and some horrible,
			 stitched-corpse giant, standing 20' high.
			-The sound seemed to come from beneath the fighting pit's flooring, clamorously loud.
		-Silent Onyx wisely recommended avoiding that mess, if possible.
		-We searcehd the outside of the arena, and Blade spotted a grate covering a large sewer
		 pipe running into the arena.
			-Presumably used when flooding the arena for the naval battles they occasionally host.
		-Golden Blade quickly ripped the grate from the stonework, and we entered the sewer.
	-The sewer indeed led into the coliseum. A short way in, we took a stair up, and found ourselves
	 in a corpse-choked hallway.
		-The corpses soon began to stir, though, rising as undead, and battle was joined.
		-Onyx cut down a few and then, adjusting my claws, I stepped into the fray and became a
		 blender. Mere seconds later, I stood panting, covered in blood and surounded by severed
		 body parts.
		-Blade then stepped over the corpses and, walking into the room they'd emerged from, his
		 glowing caste mark illuminated the source of the noise.
		-There before him stood an abomination, nearly a dozen children stitched together, their
		 lungs pulled from their backs and stitched into a slowly pulsating nightmare-organ, the
		 source of the noise.
		-From behind it too, a red light began to glow, revealing another deathknight, the mustached
		 "physician" Onyx and I had encountered before, and undoubtedly the creator of these
		 abominations.
		-The bastard that made this thing being too far for me to reach immediately, I ran at his
		 abominable creation, attempting to rend it apart. It proved surprisingly tough and dense,
		 though, with only one swipe from my claws doing any apparent damage, tearing some of it's
		 stiches.
		-Onyx joined me in that experiencing similarly limited success, though the thing was
		 starting to show it's wear.
		-The horror on hand apparently not being enough, the deathknight opened his mouth and
		 shoved a meathook down his throat, then pulled it back out, drawing forth a swarm of ghosts
		 with it.
		-Blade joined us in wailing on the noise machine, finally silencing, though perhaps not
		 destroying, it.
		-That sorted for the moment, at least, I lept over it and the ghosts, using a pillar to
		 redirect myself at the deathknight, plunging my claws into his chest.
			-As my right hand struck home, the wound quickly dissolved into liquid gore, forcing
			 the claw back out and reforming, healed.
			-The second, though, plunged in deep, and, though a similar thing began to occur, he
			 seemed unable to reform, instead collapsing into a pool of gore.
			-As that happened, the ghosts turned back to him, falling on the corpse link hungry
			 dogs, dragging his body off with them into the darkness.
		-Onyx and Blade then finished off the cacaphony abomination.
	-With the thing quieted, we could now here the sounds of people on the street above, sounding
	 like some life returning to the city.
	-The area down here had been turned into some kind of necromantic amplification chamber, and I
	 was interested in studying the works of our enemies. As such, we sent Onyx above, to see both
	 what happened to the undead titan above and to see if the destruction of _this_ abomination had
	 solved the illness.
	-Onyx came back a short while later, reporting that, indeed, the city's health seemed to be
	 restored, and, though it did not fall with it's creator, The Emissary had arrived and dealt
	 with the titan above (seeming a bit pissed, he said, that we'd left it to her).
	-We then sent him back out again, back to Hawke's compound, to retrieve squad of Hawke's men to
	 secure this area.
		-While waiting on their return, I had some time to go through what was here.
		-There were many texts covering surgery, and other, more gruesome topics, diagrams for
		 strange, necromantic weapons. I gathered up what I could.
		-It appeared hastily set up, rather than something that had been here long.
	-It was Nissen who found us first, though. He was happy to report the deaths of a further three
	 deathknights, all the cult knew of in the city.
		-He also asked that, seeing as The Illuminated had fulfilled their end of the bargain, were
		 we ready to go train with them?
		-I cautioned him that we wished to check in with our allies and. . . one other, but said that
		 then, yes, we'd be willing to join them for the training.
		-He nodded and said that he'd work on burning the bodies above, then, so that ghosts do not
		 rise, while we waited for Hawke's men.
		-I bundled up the necromancer's writings that I found in a scrap of cloth, and then went to
		 help him in that. As they arrived and saw us, Hawke's men wordlessly joined in.
	-During that, Blade pulled me aside for a bit. We found a secluded spot and called out to The
	 Emissary, beneath the light of the sun. We reported that all deathknights we'd learned of were
	 now dead, and asking if she knew of any more.
		-By way of response, images of The Emissary appeared all around the city, on street corners
		 and rooftops. She/it announced that a new law was being made for Nexus: The Wyld Hunt and
		 The Immaculate Order are henceforth banned from the city of Nexus, and Solars are welcome
		 and to be given sanctuary. (!!!)
	-That done, we assented to the cultist's training, and we were given a week to settle our affairs.
		-At their suggestion, we let Hawke know we were going to be with the cult, so he could contact
		 us in an emergency.
		-To me, they mentioned they'd send a circle to watch over my monastery, and to inform the
		 monks where I was. I told them I'd speak with them myself, but, upon using my wooden face,
		 I could see that Aslag, Kismet, and Kouf, Solar's we'd met among the cultists, were already
		 there.
	-With matters settled, we traveled beneath the city, and began our training.
		-On the first day, they shaved our heads (those that had not already, anyways) and eyebrows.
		 They also announced that our diets would be restricted to rice and tubers.
		-Kicked awake the next morning, we were dragged out for prayer. We were instructed to hold
		 martial arts stances throughout the prayers, hit with sticks when we faltered.
			-Just like childhood thus far!
			-During this, we were provided nothing but water with an oily sheen on it, and we quickly
			 began to hullucinate.
			-The prayers were over _us_, praying to heaven to guide us on our paths.
			-We were to remain until every mortal left.
		-The remainder of that day, and the latter half of many days that followed, consisted of a
		 tour of the sewers, each location requiring us to do something disgusting, much like wading
		 in shit to get to the sanctuary in the first place.
		-We trained for _three years_.
		-We saw parts of the sewers we'd never would have suspected existed. Archery ranges, combat
		 dojos, and obstacle courses.
		-A major focus of the training was on how to destabilize areas, rally followers, and spread
		 their brand of revolution.
		-For the first year, we were woken up before anyone else, and sent to scavenge for scraps of
		 garbage, to feed us and the rest of the cult.
		-As our training progressed, each of us had many mortal cultists tell us a personal secret
		 and pledge loyalty to us. That bond was then tested, and we were trained in the skills we'd
		 need to manage these groups of followers.
			-We're all going to be gaining some dots in the Followers background.
		-For the second year, we were each made to pick a "calling" with in the cult to train further
		 with. They are:
				Oyabun: The leaders of the underground Sanctuary who live on the streets among creations lowest, witnessing firsthand the struggles of creations denizens and working to help the people who need it most. They are trained to be social engineers, capable of helping creation to a better tomorrow, where everybody is equal.

				Kyodai: The street Messiahs of the sanctuary who feed the homeless and run a series of soup kitchens to feed and assist the most vulnerable of creation. They give vocational training to people and help them to organize. Their training focuses on self sustainability and the creation of  localized renewable systems from farms to power grids. 

				Shatei: The Warriors of the sanctuary, effectively protest organizers and organized resistance recruiters, they have the ability to take an unorganized mob and turn them into guerrillas capable of bringing down governments from within. These revolutionaries speak of a better tomorrow, and how creation will be better for it, but to make that tomorrow a reality they must be willing to fight for their ideals and stand against the tyrants who would take advantage of the people!
		-I chose Oyabun.
		-We now also were sent out, to explore various parts of the sewers with our followers,
		 securing new areas, converting or driving off any existing denizens and claiming the areas
		 for the cult.
			-Along the way, the tasks emphasized the use of our followers, and that we could not do
			 it alone
		-For the third year, they had us track dangerous foes, monsters, Immaculate monks, and the
		 like.
			-The tests in this year required several times the sacrifice of things that were dear,
			 mimicing the sorcery trials.
		-By the end of this, we'd acquired:
			-Abilities:
				Larceny 3, war 2, socialize 1, melee or martial arts 1, presence 1, resistance 1,
				survival 1
				(If something would push you past five, it's a free dot in any other ability, including
				 choosing martial arts "6" even though you could get melee.)
			-Charms: Ox Body + Second Larceny Excellency
			-Pick one of these pairs:
				flawlessly impenetrable disguise, body mending meditation
				second presence excellency + Enemy castigating solar judgement
				Mob dispersing rebuke + mastery of small manners
			-You also get new favored ("calling") abilities, based on the calling you pick:
				Oyabun
					Larceny, Lore, Presence, Survival, War
				Kyodai
					Awareness, Bureaucracy, Medicine, Socialize, Larceny
				Shatei
					Athletics, Larceny, Melee, Resistance, War
				(If you already favor one you're getting again, it doubles the impact, adjusting
				 XP costs and training time by twice as much.)
			-Backgrounds: Illumination 3 (see cult's source book), Henchmen 1
				-I lose my Cult, though, as they convert to The Cult of the Illuminated (sounds like
				 it was quite easy).
				-Give Lesley some info about your Henchman, their name and what they can do (or go
				 so far as to create a character for them).
					-Lesley said they should be a Heroic Mortal.
						-Rules on pg. 81 of Core.
			-You also have plenty of time to spend your (now massive) pile of XP, as well as plenty
			 access to training in essentially everything here.
				-In fact, the trainers reduce the XP cost of everything by 2 XP, to a minimum of 1 XP.
				-They very much encouraged you and Jake to pursue your training charms (not at all
				 a bad idea).
				-Even initiation into Celestial was possible, with guidance from a woman named Ayesha.
		-All this training was also interwoven with _intense_ indoctrination.
			-Among other things, they're _very_ against letting others realize you're Solars.
			-Libak, though, took time to help all of us push back a bit against the indoctrination
			 (avoiding the weird limit break stuff that the cult membership would otherwise inflict
			 on us.)


TODO:
	-Do free updates.
		-DONE with free abilities
			-I put the dot that would have been Martial Arts 6 in Integrity 4
		-DONE Pick a Calling. Might depend a lot on what you spend XP on.
			-You're going with the Oyabun Calling.
		-DONE with free no-choice charms.
		-DONE with free choice of charm pair.
			-Chose Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise + Body Mending Meditation
		-DONE with Background updates.
		-DONE Flesh out your Henchman.
			-Scroll of Heroes has the rules for Heroic Mortals.
			-Created henchman.txt for this purpose.
	-Spend XP.
		-Possibilities:
			-Essence 5: 30 XP
				-Lots of stuff is keyed off it: hearthstone health levels, Essence pool (10 more),
				 Caste anima ability, minimum damage, Snake Form
			-Celestial Circle Sorcery: 6 XP (!)
				-What spells?
					-Second Circle Demons are awesome. Ah, maybe too awesome to control?
					-Imbue Amalgam is a route to similar stuff to as Wyld shaping. Cheaper to access, but a
					 more than a bit slave-y.
					-Threefold Binding of the Heart is even more powerful mind control.
					-Raise the Puissant Sanctum (White Treatise pg. 79) for manse construction.
					-Cloud Trapeze (White Treatise pg. 70) is a slight improvement on Sormwind.
					-The Faithful Ally (White Treatise pg. 71) is solid.
					-Unity of Dreams (White Treatise pg. 85) would be uncomfortably intimate, but
					 would provide a months long buff to the circle, and provides limited teleport.
					-Whirlwind of Fate (White Treatise pg. 86) is decent with good planning.
				-_Solar_ Circle would also be cheap then, if you have Essence 5!
			-More Terrestrial spells?
				-Infallible Messenger is taught by the cult.
				-Unbreakable Bones of Stone (White Treatise pg. 66) is Essence to Str & Sta, and
				 halved-round-down wound penalties. Probably better than Burning Eyes.
				-So are the blasting spells, Butterflies and Flight of the Brilliant Raptor.
					-Oh! 3+ others too.
				-Peacock Shadow Eyes (White Treatise pg. 55) is _cheaper_ mind control.
				-Ritual of Elemental Empowerment (White Treatise pg. 57)?
				-Unconquerable Self (White Treatise pg. 66) is a 2 XP suicide tooth.
			-Lore charms can be as cheap as 4XP!
				-Another Excellency.
				-Both training charms, after another Excellency.
				-Wyld charms, after another Excellency.
					-3 deep for Cauldron (third shaping charm needs prohibitive Essence 7).
			-Specialties: 1 XP each (!)
				-Unarmed Dodge and Martial Arts are attractive ones.
			-Occult Charms?
			-More Snake Style: 6 XP each
				-3 Charms would get you to Striking Serpent Speed, and some half-decent stuff along
				 the way. Probably not worth it if you don't go that deep, but does also argue for
				 more essence.
			-Willpower 8: 12 XP
				-Better reading of invisible manse hearthstone would benefit from it, as would spells.
			-Medicine and Genesis?
			-Necromancy?
				-Pretty specialized, but in something we care about. What does the cult think?
		-Proposal:
			XP:	Spent On:
			12	Third Lore Excellency and the first two Lore training charms
			4	2 more dots of Unarmed Dodge & Martial Arts specialties (DID MACRO UPDATES!)
			6	Celestial Sorcery (WHAT DO YOU SACRIFICE? Your name.)
			18	3 more spells:
					Imbue Amalgam

			1	Stealth 1
			1	Temperance 2
			--
			52
				or
			30	Essence 5?
				or
			12	3 Wyld Lore charms?
	-Flesh out downtime more.
		-Garn's reaction to training/indoctrination?
		-How your monks integrate?
			-The various cells of the cult already have widely varying doctrines.
		-Talk with kid who fled? Involve Libak? Build a bit of a powerbase.
			-Talked with Lesley about it.
			-Named Black Sheep. Dawn Caste with anger issues. Murdered his family in a rage when he
			 exalted.
			-Had a conversation with him and Libak, sharing what I'm trying so hard to convince
			 myself of. We're The Chosen of the Sun, but that doesn't mean we cannot fail. We need
			 to guard against that, and watch ourselves, because Creation _needs_ us not to fail.
		-What about our allied Exalts?
			-Did The Mistress join the cult with us?
				-Yep!
				-She renamed herself The Penitent of the Hallowed Path.
				-In fact, the Cult has another Abyssal among them, Waters the Fields with Blood,
				 and had been studying him for some time.
			-What's our dynast friend up to?
				-Perhaps leave a parting message with her, asking her to both keep an eye out for
				 more deathknights and to use the cities considerable stores of knowledge to learn
				 more about what the hell they are. Tell her to keep in contact with us if need be
				 through Hawke and Rishi.
				-Talking with Lesley, she's been doing exactly that. In particular, she's been
				 studying the Monstrance of Celestial Portion.
					-She believes it contains two Abyssal Exaltations.
					-The Mistress claims it's not only able to make Abyssal Exalts but that, with
					 sufficient Necromancy, could even make a Solar Exaltation into an Abyssal one,
					 that being how some of her former circlemates were made.
	-Take another look at Hearthstone_of_the_invisible_fortress.odt. For better and worse, you've
	 been forgetting some of the wacky things it does.
	-Pick up that armor you commissioned?
		-Done!
	-Wooden Face for The Cult?
		-Asked about this and the above here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/926239488957636678
		-Done!
	-Record Garn learning the 0-level Thaumaturgy rituals that his henchman can teach him, now that
	 he's paying attention.
		-Oh, wait, these probably require an XP spend, so you won't likely bother.
	-You sacrificed the name "Garn", for knowledge of The Celestial Circle of Sorcery.
		-It is no longer "you",  spiritually and mystically, and many who know that name find it hard
		 to remember.
		-You had an extensive discussion with Lesley about it here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/926186066422145034
		-What form did The Five Ordeals take under Ayesha?
			-Humility is already well emphasized by the training camp, and _all_ of the circle
			 underwent many such suitable trials.
			-Tutelage involved watching, shadowing, and studying the many and complicated ebbs and
			 flows among Nexus's teeming masses, how the flowing essence of so many people in motion
			 created patterns far weaker than the dragon lines spanning Creation, but _infintely
			 more complex.
				-The monastery-raised First Light's Dragon had previously been blinder than most to
				 such things, but The Cult takes humanity _seriously_. 
				-Fits the Socialize dot The Cult has now granted you, and maybe an eventual foray
				 into the Bureaucracy stuff you still delegate to others.
	-Did anyone implant the Bracers of Universal Crafting? If not, it's getting to the point you could
	 make decent use of them.
	-Was it Tidal Force you were fighting when you exalted?
		-Nah. Reviewing your background, you like the name "Brother Jin" that's there, and you
		 imagine he's still a fervent follower, while Tidal Force seems a bit more skeptical.


1/3/22:
	-During our training downtime, an older Sideral named Kai (who seems to be a bit insane) _knew_
	 we had the mirror, and approached us about it.
		-He'd been studying the Abyssals and The Deathlords.
		-He intends to form a strike force, to act against The Mask of Winters, and strike a blow
		 against the Deathlords.
		-He believes The Black Mirror will be integral to that task, and understanding Abyssals,
		 saying it was "fated to be so."
		-He arranged to have Waters the Fields with Blood look into it and he became, to all we
		 could see, a Solar.
		-It did not last, though, and, when he returned to his dark self, shadowland-energey and
		 ravenous spectres flooded forth from him, thankfully contained by wards, but limiting
		 further study of this.
		-Kai knew the mirror had been been dug from where the primordial Perfect Principal of
		 Consumption had been slain.
	-The Cult has warned us that, as we've grown more powerful, we've grown easier to spot for those
	 watching Fate.
		-In particular, any flare of our anima or charm with the Obvious keyword gives them a chance.
		-A d10 is then rolled, and if it's less than your essence, it's spotted.
	-It is also no secret to us that we've quickly become the most powerful circle in The Cult's
	 training camp.
	-While we've trained, Nexus has thrived, despite some issues.
		-Our battle with the Deathknights in the city shook things up a bit, and The Emissary's
		 proclamation provoked a backlash from merchants convinced they'd been doomed to destruction
		 by The Wyld Hunt.
		-Hawke's Chargers have risen in prominence, but word got out about his contract, with rivals
	     impeding the works projects Hawke was initiating, hoping to claim ground.
		-Trade, though, has thrived on the turmoil.
		-The Cult of the Illuminated has been pushing into places vacated by the banished Immaculate
		 Order, spreading rumors they were to blame for the Deathknight incursion.
		-There seems to have been a scandal affecting Libak's family, a cousin linked to organized
		 crime, the snakeman Ophilis Ses.
			-Through a mix of The Cult and spies in Golden Blade's employ, we've learned things
			 about him that few know.
			-His Tang Zen are apparently actually based out of Great Forks, and he is the lover of
			 a Solar from that city, Azure Path.
			-The Tang Zen are small in number, but highly influential throughout The Riverlands.
	-The power The Cult is most concerned about is The Mask of Winters.
		-There have been many skirmishes between his forces and The Marukani.
		-One of his Deathknights sits on The Council of the Concordant, and has been waging the
		 same war diplomatically, claiming the the towns The Mask has seized have joined the rule
		 of Thorns willingly.
		-Many of The Riverlands' powers are sympathetic to that, fearing that, should Lookshy get
		 involved, it would heavily disrupt the province.
	-At one point, Ayesha, who initiated you into The Celestial Circle, asked if you planned to
	 return to manse in the North.
		-I responded, "Yes. There is much left to uncover there."
		-In response, she summoned a silvery gateway, and led me within, past the Celestial Lions
		 and into Yu-Shan.
		-Within the heavenly city, she led me to a jade dome, with lines of spirits waiting to get
		 in, and took me inside, to a doorway.
			-She addressed the Celestial Lions guarding the dooway, saying we were on business for
			 "The Forbidden Manse of Ivy".
		-That led out onto the frozen, windswept valley before The Invisible Manse, opening a door
		 in the side of a mountain there, to the skyship hanger we'd seen on it's blueprints.
		-Inside was a grisly scene, the long desicatted corpses of dead dragonborn, one bearing what
		 I recognized Meherrin's spear, and a craft shaped like a seed.
		-With the hearthstone, I was able to activate the ship.
			-It proved to be a Manta-Class Transport (Wonders of the Lost Age pg. 43).
		-Ayesha, piloting it, took it out of it's berth, and into the sky.
		-The next part, I was asked not to repeat. Ayesha took the craft down into a lake, our
		 surroundings dissolved into flowers, and, when the receded, we were a mile from Nexus,
		 on the river.
			-Quite the trick.
		-Before bringing it into the city, though, she had another question for me, saying that,
		 "Your companion Libak's fate is clouded, difficult to see. You have a choice, though. If
		  this spear is returned to him, his path may grow. . . dark, drenched in blood. Would you
		  return this to him? Or deliver it to me, and spare him that?"
		 "Well, I know what he would chose, if that is so, and I will assent to his choice. Here."
		 "You must not tell him of this, then."
		 "I will not bring it up. If he asks, though. . . he may well see through me. See that he
		  does not ask."
			-Hmm. . . 
		-Back in Nexus, she provided us with the service of a suitable crew for the skyship.
	-After we completed our training, we got word from three brothers, Illuminated monks.
		-A member of their cell had been captured, held by the local horselord and an Immaculate
		 official, and they mean to burn her at the stake.
		-With the skyship, we can reach there in time, and we quickly debated a plan.
			-We opted to disguise ourselves as traveling traders, to enter the town without alerting
			 them (obviously setting the skyship down somewhere out of sight).
	-After four hours travel and concealing the grounded ship, we approached what, to all appearances,
	 seemed to be a normal village.
		-Well, walking around, _one_ building stood out, it being substantially fortified.
			-Outside stood an Immaculate Monk, praying, and from within drifted the scent of
			 inscence.
		-Pip strode boldy up to one of the guards at the door, introducing herself as a trader,
		 newly arrived.
		-The guard called within, to his lord, asking him if he had need of traders. I did not hear
		 the muffled response, but we were then admitted.
		-That was followed by a search of our possessions by the guards within.
			-We were wise enough to bring packs of various innocuous goods, though they still
			 confiscated many higher value items, like bars of soap. When questioned, the one word
			 response was "taxes".
			-We then had a brief audience with the horse lord within, Himvul, but he had no interest
			 in our uninteresting goods and we were soon dismissed.
				-When Pip asked what the lord _would_ wish, he responded that he desired the herbs
				 necessary to test if someone was a witch.
		-While we were busy with that, Silent Onyx and Sparrow looked through the village.
			-It's primary resource was soon apparent, as the trees that surrounded the villlage were
			 in fact _ironwood_ trees, and many things in the village were made from it.
			-It was also obvious where the "witch" was likely kept, for there was a bell tower with
			 no bell, and instead barred windows and a guard.
			-The also found markings associated with The Cult of the Illuminated on one building.
			-The villagers, though, seemed to be half-starved, and the vegetable gardens around the
			 town seemed stricken with some kind of blight.
		-As we caught up about that, we spotted some commotion in the market place, a guard
		 harassing a peasant and merchant, demanding more "taxes".
			-By the time Libak intervened, the guard was threatening to cut off the peasant's finger
			 in lieu of the tax he did not have.
			-Libak paid a bribe to the guard, claiming business with them that he wished to urgently
			 attend to.
			-Both were grateful, and we later spoke with the merchant within his home.
			-He spoke of Himvul's depredations, that bandits Himvul was paying off with the majority
			 of their ironwood, and the futility of the situation.
			-He did mention an "idealist" Dao who sought to change this all, but did not hold much
			 hope. He was willing to direct us to Dao, but said he could do little to help, being
			 preoccupied with his brother's hard times, his brother's wife, Kerala, having been taken
			 by Lord Himvul. Accussed of witchcraft, he claimed she'd sacrificed a child to some 
			 cult of the dead, and the lord awaited a magistrate, to try and sentence her.
		-We went off in search of Dao, only to see a pair emerging from the house we were directed to.
			-One supported the other, who appeared to be drunk, and was certainly in tears.
			-Libak asked him what was wrong, while a third villager, quite similar in appearance to
			 the pair and, as he approached, made to Sparrow a Cult of the Illuminated recognition
			 sign, one which was quickly returned.
			-This latecomer then ushered us all over to his home. He stated he'd recognized young
			 Sparrow as a "brother", and Pip chimed in that we were "kin" as well.
			-We learned the story of Kerala. She had been wont to take the village children on walks
			 in the wilderness, identifying useful herbs. One afternoon, the boy with her was bitten
			 by a snake. She tried to suck the venom from the wound, and, failing that, opened it
			 wider, to let the venom flow out with the blood. The child died, and she was found, with
			 blood on her face and singing an ancient song, one the village once used to send off
			 their dead. They called it a sacrifice.
			-"Used to?" Libak asked, "What happened?"
			-The Immaculate Order ended that when it came. It slew their priest, and cut the tongues
			 from all who knew the old songs, save Kerala who none but the priest knew had learned
			 them. When Lord Himvul exalted, they sent a priest here to stay, to guide him.
	-Pip decided to start up a couple of word-of-mouth campaigns, against both the abuse of taxes
	 and The Immaculate Faith.
		-Meanwhile, I spent my time investigating the blight affecting the town's foodstuffs.
			-The food crops, _and only the food crops_ were affected by a fungus. Examining it with
			 Essence Sense, though, made apparent that the fungus propogated along patterns
			 suggestive of the land's finest ley lines. I suspected the work of necrotic wood essence,
			 emanating from one of Creation's dragon lines. But while such a thing could be an 
			 intentional attack, the formation of shadowlands or corruption of key manses would
			 necessarily cause such harm, whatever goal or random chance may have caused that.
		-Blade, meanwhile, detailed some of his toops, sending them out as scouts into the surrounding
		 area in search of the bandits.
			-Well, he tried to, anyways, but, upon returning to the ship, he found they had a captive,
			 bearing the emblem of a red eye on a white mountain.
				-He was indeed a bandit, and the emblem was that of his company.
				-Blade interrogated him (with Judge's Ear).
					-They seem to have spiritual backing: "By the glory of Mother Bog. . ."
					-He mentioned selling the occupants of some previous town to the fey, at which
					 point Golden Blade became pissed, and the captive was disarmed (and then beaten
					 to death with said arm).
					-Turning to his men, "Give me another one."
		-Silent Onyx cased the old bell tower.
	-Gathering again, we discussed what we'd each done, and our next steps.
		-It seems we've made good progress formenting rebellion against the horse lord, but no real
		 progress filling any resulting vacuum.
		-I advocated looking into the horse god of the Marukani. One of his hairs is the traditional
		 marker of Marukani nobility. Perhaps he can be found and bargained with.
			-Asking Dao, he knew tales of the god, despite Immaculate supression, integral as it
			 was to Marukani culture.
			-The hairs were rewards for acts of heroism undertaken in the sacred mountains. A horse,
			 something this especially poor Marukani town lacks outside the horse lord's private
			 stock, would also go a very long ways to help one's cause, given the god and culture.
			-I had proposed Dao for the role, but the circle pointed out that Kerala also fit, and
			 had, with the dying boy, already committed an arguable act of heroism.
		-We also discussed substituting Pip or myself with Kerala, via Flawlessly Impenetrable
		 Disguise, freeing her to seek her elevation.


TODO:
	-Figure out the parameters of Bronze Faction Fate monitoring.
		-Can the The Cult _shield_ you from this in some way? Otherwise, how does practice in the
		 training camps work?
			-Yep, they can manage localized stuff: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/929138934733230151
			-They cover the training camps, at least.
			-They've also suggested that The Inivisible Manse is similarly hidden.
		-Can understanding of this, my impressive Occult and Lore, and Libak and Pip's Bureaucracy
		 be combined to create a kind of "side-channel" attack, monkey-wrenching the Bronze Faction
		 despite our limited interface with their organization?
			-Eh, doesn't sound like it, from discussion in #general.


1/31/22:
	-We continued to debate our course of action in this town, and settled on a general goal of
	 elevating Kerala in Himvul's place, as horse lord of the village.
		-To that end, Pip employed her subtle social manipulations to burnish the image of both Kerala
		 and the traditional Marukani ways.
		-We also decided to follow up on the necrotic essence affecting the town's food crops, with
		 the aid of Yflea.
		-It seemed potentially the sort of heroic deed the god of the Marukani was looking for, and
		 also the sort of thing Kerala's knowledge of local spirit lore might aid.
		-As such, we decided we'd free her. Several of us could manage a suitable disguise, to replace
		 her in prison, but none could sneak in and out quite like Silent Onyx, so he volunteered to
		 take her place.
			-(James was also not responding until half way through the session, so it seemed a good
			 way to tuck Silent Onyx away.)
			-A short while later, I indeed got to meet her for the first time, as she met us at the
			 appointed spot outside of town.
			-She carries herself like a noble, at least, even garbed as a peasant. Good material to
			 work with, for our coup here.
	-So, we headed back to our ship, intending to fetch Yflea from Nexus.
		-Arriving there, though, Blade's troops informed us that there'd been futher attacks.
			-Not by bandits, though, but by strange humanoid figures made from swamp debris, aided
			 by animated vines.
			-Such things sounded like elementals or demons to me, though I did not know the specific
			 type. They seemed, though, to likely be related to the bandit's in the area, since the
			 captive one had mentioned a "Mother Bog".
		-Leaving Blade and his troops behind to backup Silent Onyx as needed, we boarded the ship
		 and flew to Nexus.
			-Looking down as we flew, we saw much activity in the land. Bands of Lookshy troops and
			 horsemen with Marukani banners were seen on the move, heading Southwest.
				-No doubt towards Thorns. . .
				-Most such bands were all of one nation, but we did see some mixed groups, and
				 interesting indicator of the politcal winds.
			-Arriving in Nexus, I went to the training camp, to retrieve Yflea and help him load his
			 equipment aboard the ship, what he'll need for the geomantic rituals.
			-Meanwhile, Libak had indicated he wanted to check in on his family, and he went to take
			 care of that. I _had_ heard they were having some trouble (see notes above). . .
			-Pip too wanted to check on her mother, so we decided to all meet back at the ship in
			 two hours.
	-Pip returned to the ship in a rage, saying her mother had been taken be triad members, who may
	 have delivered her to the Tang Zen. She meant to find them, rescue her mother, and _hurt_ them.
		-I agreed with her the matter was urgent, and so we sent Yflea and the ship's crew off back
		 to the village.
			-Yflea was to begin his investigation under the protection of Golden Blade's men, and
			 the crew was to return here with Blade.
		-Meanwhile, through our allies, we sought word of Tang Zen hideouts in the Firewander
		 district, learning of five of them.
			-Pip was definitely in a rage, threatening great displays of Solar wrath. Libak, Blade,
			 and I tried to convince her discretion might be wise, but I'm not sure that we were
			 successful.
		-We then sought out the first of their hideouts, with Pip running straight up to the door
		 and banging on it, threatening death to all inside, if her questions are not answered (and,
		 also, once they are).
			-A small bar, people soon began to stream out of it, running and screaming.
			-Others, though, stood up from their stools and drew knives, with the bartender yelling,
			 "You can _try_ to kill us, anathema! We won't yield!"
			-The inside of the bar was soon painted with blood, but Libak had spared one, who he
			 dragged to a back room to interrogate.
				-I meanwhile wiped blood off myself while Pip and Blade rummaged through the bottles
				 at the bar and drank.
			-Libak came out, still clearly shaken, asking us not to kill the man who booked it out
			 the front door without looking at us.
				-I asked Libak what he'd learned, and he said the man had claimed _not_ to work for
				 the Tang Zen, though we're still convinced the triad he's a member of is. He _also_
				 claimed that, when in town, Ophilis Ses stays at a jail in the district.
				-Ses is quite the target. Perhaps we can cut the head off this snake, or at least
				 gain all the leverage we could desire to secure the release of Pip's mother.
		-We then went in search of the jail.
			-As we did so, The Penitent found us, saying that her spies had heard of the action at
			 the bar (James showed up after being AWOL, so he's playing her while Silent Onyx is in
			 that tower).
			-Mercenaries known as The Hooded Executioners, sometimes called "The Black Cloaks",
			 perform policing duties in the Firewander, and are likely the ones _supposed_ to be
			 running this jail.
			-Pip was eager, but the rest of us thought it best to look into what sort of arrangement
			 they might have with the Tang Zen.
				-Eh, did a fair amount of debating, but ultimately didn't learn much before we headed
				 to the prison.
			-Heading to the jail, we once again opted for the "front door" approach.
			-This time, though, Pip was willing to talk first, thought she took a direct approach,
			 asking directly for Ophilis Ses.
			-That yielded, from the guard, a "Leave." He then began trying push Pip back out the door.
			-There was some commotion, then, and a new voice from inside the door: "Let them in. I've
			 been expecting them."
				-A thing Libak noted was true.
				-In the foyer stood a richly dressed snakeman with copper scales, who indeed proved
				 to be Ophilis Ses.
				-He claimed that the men sent to fetch Pip's mother were incompetent, and are now
				 dead, their heads on pikes in the yard. He claimed she has not been harmed.
					-Turning to Libak, he nodded at that.
				-Pip asked to see her, to which he assented, sending the door guard to retrieve her.
				-When she came, she seemed to have been treated well.
				-He also claimed that bringing her was the only way to protect her, but that received
				 a grimace from Libak.
				-He said something about having gotten what he wanted, asking us if we knew what would
				 come after us. Pip responded yes, and he replied that we were either very brave or
				 very stupid. . .
				-He then said, "Well, I expect you wish to take me into custody?"
				 "Yes," Pip replied.
				 "I will go with you, then, if you'll promise not to harm me."
				 "You did not harm my mother, so I will assent."
				 "Very well. The oath is sanctified," he said, as his anima flared.
				-He then explained that he had simply wished to speak to us.
					-He knew of our shared past, and of the manse.
					-He asked us to join with him, to kill Itraxian, blaming her for never returning
					 to us, after seeing our dragonblooded persecutors brought low by The Great
					 Contagion. "She could have told us! We could have restored Creation to it's
					 lost glory!"
					-Our circle was united in opposition.
						-"Why divide ourselves against one another, given the forces arrayed against
						 us?" I asked. "You blame her for not giving you the chance to restore
						 Creation. Why not seize the chance you have now?"
						 "She took from me what's mine!"
						 "What's yours?"
						 "Hollow! Don't you remember?!? I _built_ this city! I laid it's first
						 foundations with my bare hands!"
					-We also argued with him that he was identifying _way_ too much with his past
					 incarnation.
						-"I think neither you nor I would wish for me to claim every perogative
						 Larquen Quen did. . ."
					-We tried arguing too that Itraxian had protected the city from The Wyld Hunt,
					 but he responded that he'd done far more than she ever did.
						-"What did you do?" Pip asked.
						 "Set in motion plans that took time to come to fruition. I just needed you
						 here."
					-We suddenly felt it neccessary to check on The Emissary, stepping out and
					 looking up, to see Itraxian in the sky having a crazy martial arts battle in
					 the air with four other figures.
					-"Who are those figures?" I asked, "The Hunt? Yours?"
					 "They didn't know who she was, and thus could not marshal the proper forces. I
					 told them who she was."
					 "The Sidereals, then."
					 "The masters of The Wyld Hunt."
					-We fell to arguing among ourselves, about whether to aid Itraxian, what to do
					 about Ses, etc.
						-As we did so, we witnessed flash of rainbow light above as one of the
						 figures struck Itraxian, shattering the mask of The Emissary from her face.
						 Her caste mark then flared, as she was surrounded by an anima banner of
						 golden light.
							-This was soon followed by shouts on the street: "The Emissary! She's
							 an anathema!"
					-Eventually, we decided there was likely little we could do about anyone
					 threatening a millenia-old Solar, even if we could reach them in the sky, and
					 that we still wished to hold onto Ophilis Ses.
						-We thought it best to take him to The Cult of the Illuminated, but Blade
						 asked him if that is what he expected, and Ophilis responded, "Yes."
						-We tried binding him with the Manacles of Night, but, as he predicted,
						 they would not close around his wrists: "It is no longer in my nature to
						 be a prisoner, and Creation agrees."
						-Hmm. . .
					-We at least began to lead him out of the prison.
						-The streets were in chaos, as rioting and panic broke out.
						-He, meanwhile, brought his brandy bottle.
	-As we walked out, one of the figures battling Itraxian was cast down from the sky, shattering
	 several buildings he flew through.
		-Nonetheless, the figured stood, bloody but alive. He was garbed as an Immaculate Monk, but
		 his eyes glowed purple, and he had a matching halo.
		-This was our opportunity, if we're to help Itraxian. Looking at each other, it seemed we
		 were all resolved to do so, as we fell into stances and the like.


2/14/22: A St. Valentine's Day Massacre
	-I myself fell into Snake Form, as the Wyld Hunter slowly got to his feat.
	-The monk-garbed assassin, seeing three of my companions suddenly glow as their anima flared,
	 turned to us, and lept forward, bizzarely throwing a paper crane at Pip as he did so.
		-The crane left a minor cut wound across her shoulder, but the world also seemed to. . .
		 twist as it did so. The world around us grew gray and murky, and the crane soared back off
		 into that murk.
	-Pip and The Penitent swung at the monk, who now glowed, with a red circle on his forehead, but
	 there blows seemed to pass through his form.
	-Blade met no greater success with his own strike, despite cleverly kicking up a paving stone
	 as a distraction prior to it.
		-However, the red glow grew brighter, and a strange band of white silk appeared from the
		 murk, wrapping around Blade and pulling him closer to the monk.
	-With my wooden claws twisting, forming a great single blade on each hand, I wove in between
	 Pip and Ses, twisting to suddenly strike at the monk.
		-My attacks were countered seemingly differently, with ribbons of white silk emerging from
		 the murk to pull each of my hands away at the last moment.
		-This felt familiar. . . a martial arts technique that I. . . no, that Larquen had once
		 dueled against.
		-"I can keep this up all day!" I shouted, adding, "Can you?"
	-The Emissary above now resembled a many-armed golden goddess, and was continuing her battle with
	 the others.
	-It seems the Immaculate Sidereal knew all manner of ways to dodge an attack, demonstrating at
	 least three as we all tried again and again to land a blow.
	-Libak tried a different tack, and had greater success _offending_ the monk, as he shouted
	 insults leading to a seeming change in the murk, swirling suddenly more intensely around Libak.
	-Golden Blade then managed to burst the silk bands he was wrapped in, but still could not land
	 a blow.
	-This all continued on for some time.
		-Attacks fueled by essence, though, seemed to evoke a different counter, the silk-from-the-
		 mist diverting them. Each seemed to get a bit closer.
	-Wearing or bored, the Immaculate monk suddenly disappeared, reappearing in a flurry of cherry
	 blossoms and paper cranes, near a fountain some 20 meters away.
		-This felt a bit familiar, the blossoms reminding me of how Ayesha got the airship back to
		 Nexus so quickly. More confirmation they're both Sidereals? Or indicative of some other
		 connection.
	-Despite us at least distracting this one, Itraxian's battle with the remaining two monks in the
	 sky did not seem to be going well.
		-She kicked one of them hard enough that it seems she killed him, but, while doing so, the
		 other got behind her, stabbing her near her kidney.
		-Seemingly in response, the crowd of scared onlookers around us all clutched the same part
		 of their chests, and we could hear cries of anguish all over the city. . .
			-Clearly there's some kind of sympathetic magic at play here. The Emissary is very much
			 thought of as the patron of Nexus. . .
	-Blade then lept at the grounded monk, closing the distance in an instance, and attempting to
	 tackle him. However, he collided with the fountain's statue instead, toppling it from it's
	 plinth.
	-The monk responded by reaching out towards Blade with his palm, the murk briefly disappearing
	 as he did so. Blade managed to interpose his blade (heh), and the hand left a melted print on
	 his daiklaive.
	-I reached him next, running up onto the fountain and leaping at him, clawed hands forward.
		-Finally, the right one connected, drawing first blood.
		-The claws of that hand sunk into part of his chest, but he seemed staggered more than I
		 would have expected from the wound.
		-It also now dawned on me what his motions and dodges reminded me: the way the Wyld
		 itself fights, chaotic forms driven by a story. Here his personal fortitude finally failed
		 him, his story giving way before the story of the dragon.
	-Seeing the connection between the city and it's Emissary, Libak sought to rally the people
	 nearby, leading them in a prayer to The Unconquered Sun, in support of Itraxian.
		-It was quite the performance, and The Emissary indeed seemed to rally, landing a tremendous
		 blow on one of her remaining attackers, punching his spine right out of his back.
		-The other, though, glowed purple, and split into many doubles of himself.
	-It would seem our monk didn't care for the sight of his own blood, as he turned to me, saying,
	 "For that, you will suffer like none have ever suffered before."
		-A dubious assertion, given that he's no lord of Malfeas or the like, but he clearly had a
		 plan to at least try and make good on that, as he reached out towards my forehead with two
		 glowing fingers.
		-I thankfully leaned back just in time, and then quickly forward with a flurry of clawed
		 strikes, though all were deflected by his suddenly-there silks.
	-Before he could try anything else, Pip also landed a blow, cutting his body in twain.
	-His body, though, dissolved into rose petals, leaving only his clothes, a few paper cranes, and
	 a nine foot long sutra.
		-Written in blood and tears on fine white silk, it is the tail of a maiden born with three
		 faces, who saw all of her life at once.
		-I recognized it as a martial arts parable, one that could allow someone attuned to this
		 artifact to activate multiple forms at once.
			-A thing Pip can make good use of.
	-The foe at hand resolved, we again looked up, just in time to see Itraxian dealt a grevious
	 blow from her remaining opponent's sword , though she tore him in half in response.
		-The sword remained, though, piercing her breast, and she sagged, then fell from the sky.
		-Pip, Libak, and I all rushed to where she fell nearby, with me pulling open my robes as
		 I ran.
		-As I got to where she lay unconscious amidst rubble on the street, my passenger emerged
		 from my chest, scuttling over to her and burrowing into her flesh.
		-While the bottlebug worked, eventually pushing the sword out and poking the occasional
		 insect legs out to pull her wounds closed, I reached out to my Wooden Face under The Cult's
		 control, telling the cultist monitoring it that, "One of the Shining Ones is in dire
		 trouble, wounded and beset by enemies! Send soldiers and doctors!"
			-I then directed them to where we are in Nexus.
	-Within ten minutes, Nissen, Jack, and Nassara, all ranking Solars in The Cult, were there with
	 us, and helping to tend to Itraxian's wounds. 20 minutes after that, she was again conscious
	 and on her feet.
	-Libak then brought Ses over to Itraxian, introducing him as "the one that sold you out."
	-"Surin," she greeted him, "I wish it was a pleasure to see you. I thought I had banned you
	 from the city."
	 "Sure," he responded, "If you can keep me out."
	 "I swore I would never raise a hand against my circlemates. . ."
	 He grinned at that, and added, "They all refuses to aid me in killing you, you know."
	 "So," he said, "Another offer: I have my own circle, and, while you were busy with this,
	 they took control of the dams around the city. Acknowledge me as the greatest among you,
	 swearing yourselves to me, or I will drown the city."
	-We fell to shouting for a bit, at Ses and among ourselves.
	-Eventually, we all seemed quite intent on ending Ses's misanthropic life (fuck his deal),
	 though I wondered if we needed him to save the city.
	-Pip, though, said that _she_, at least, could take no part, though she encouraged us. She said
	 that she would meanwhile try to do something about the dam, and started asking questions about
	 how she could get there quickest.
		-Ah, there was something I could help with, and perhaps save the city. I told her I would go
		 with her, and spoke the trigger phrase to call up a whirlwind for us.
		-The next problem, though, was that the city of Nexus didn't have any dams. . .
		-As we were born aloft through the city, though, golden images of Itraxian guided us,
		 pointing the way.
		-She led us to the Nighthammer district, to a white First Age building at the very Western
		 edge of the peninsula on which the city rests.
		-Atop the building, there was some newer construction, ramshackle shanties. The door of one
		 of them had been torn off, and there were streaks of blood all around it, but no bodies.
		-Rushing inside, Pip and I descended into the original building, then following a hallway
		 for something like a quarter mile, until we could hear rushing water above us.
		-The streaks of blood led this way, as if bodies were dragged down the corridor.
		-Eventually, along with the smell of gore, we could smell spiced smoke, and we emerged into
		 a viscera-filled room.
			-There was a great altar, constructed from the bones of the mutilated corpses around the
			 room, and draped in their organs. Atop it lay another snake man, dead from a knife in
			 his chest.
		-Along one wall, an illuminated screen showed a warning in Old Realm, speaking of activation
		 of the dam and imminent overflow.
			-The axe buried in the machine it was attached to probably wasn't helping things.
		-I tried to understand the machinery before me, to see if there was something I could do.
			-This was a matter of the utmost importance, and I gave it my all. 
			-As I did so, a more metaphorical dam broke, and it was as if I'd operated such things
			 many times. I began to operate the controls as if by rote.
				-Pip later told me that, during this, I carried myself. . . differently, proud and
				 sinuously fluid in my movements. Not unlike someone else I know all too
				 intimately. . .
			-I was able to slow the dam's closing, activate some kind of warning, and activate the
			 city's sentinel defense force, to aid in the evacuation. I was not, however, able to
			 stop the process.
			-More screens then came to life, showing various parts of the city. Sewer covers were
			 flying off, and metal soldiers emerging from the sewers and ushering people down the
			 streets.
				-They seemed to employ a strange, invisible force, herding people with it.
			-We could also hear the warning that was broadcast, in Old Realm, talking of the closing
			 dam.
				-Pip asked if I could change it to Rivertongue and I nodded, engaging the manual
				 override and recording mode.
				-In Rivertongue, she warned the city's populace of the coming clood, telling them
				 to take their things and flee the city to high ground.
	-Pip and I then took our own advice, and fled the city in another whirlwind, stopping to help
	 her mother escape as we went.
	-Outside the city, we could see a great wall of light form, cutting off the Nighthammer district
	 from the rest of the city, and blocking the flow of water. Within hours, the water had risen
	 some sixty feet above the low lying city, the Nighthammer long since innundated.
	-Eventually, the wall of light flickered, and gave out, and a great wave smashed through Nexus.
		-The heights of some of the city's hills remained undamaged, and some other First Age
		 buildings survived as well, but the vast majority of the city was flattened.
		-Even among those who did not escape in time, though, there were many survivors, protected
		 by the invisible force of the metal sentinels.
		-This devestation must have also extended far up and down the Yellow, Grey, and Yanaze rivers,
		 one of (perhaps _the_) most densely populated areas of Creation. . .
	-While Pip and I observed the city, we also saw flashes to the West.
		-They came from the Imperial Mountain, which soon began to display a red glow.
		-In fact, the same glow appeared at various points around the city, forming into a woman,
		 clad in scarlet.
		-Then, she spoke: "In my absence, you have grown complacent. As such, you will be punished.
		 You will serve the Scarlet Empress forever. I am the Scarlet Empress reborn."
		-With that, all of the images disappeared, save the great one over the Imperial Mountain.
		-Five minutes later, a column of elemental energy shot up from the Imperial Mountain, arcing
		 down to some place in the South. It shone brightly for an hour, and then dimmed.
	-Outside the city, Pip and I debated what we should do next (we not having yet reunited with
	 the others.
		-I favored contacting Itraxian and The Cult of the Illuminated both, to see what we could do
		 to help the city.
		-As we spoke of her beneath the sun, though, Itraxian came to us.
		-"Rebuilding Nexus," she said, "Will not be possible. The Realm is going to invade. Their
		 ships are already on the way."
			-I suppose they can't exactly ignore what happened here.
		-"What, then," I asked, "Are the thousands, millions here to do?"
		 "I know of a place," she replied, "Where they can go. Denandsor, the City of Makers."
		 "I remember. . . met you there. . ."
			-Clearly, Larquen had been there (see references to Denandsor above).


2/28/22:
	-Nexus is a sodden ruin.
		-Left homeless are around 640,000 refugees.
		-We (jokingly?) discussed torturing the ghost of Ses.
		-No one has seen or heard from Rishi, though Hawke has been trying to locate him.
	-Over the first day, the Emissary rested.
	-Over the second, though, she appeared as a golden light to nearly everyone in the city, guiding
	 them to useful supplies. Food, medicine, and even, aiding me personally, the precious stone and
	 gems from the Blessed Isle required for an amalgam. . .
	-The Solars of The Cult of the Illuminated also provided a great deal of aid too.
		-Black Powder Jack even showed a flare for construction, raising earthworks and wooden
		 structures from diagrams comprised of freshcut saplings.
		-We also began mass summonings of demons together, beginning with bottle bugs to aid the
		 wounded.
	-The night of that second day, we reached out to Onyx, via our shared dreams.
		-We broke the hard news to him, about Nexus, and let him know we were coming for him
		 tomorrow.
		-We asked him to sneak out and link up with Blade's troops (and Yflea) in the hills.
	-The third day, then, we indeed went to retrieve Silent Onyx and co.
		-During the flight, Sparrow, Blade's young companion, received an Infallible Messenger,
		 which spoke in a strange voice, calling him "Azada" and saying something about "The
		 Fivescore Fellowship" being recalled.
			-We've all heard the term: it's used for the secret masters of The Cult of the Illuminated,
			 presumably a reference to the Sidereals.
		-Then, with a strange look on his face, Sparrow began to perform a ritual, suddenly opening
		 some kind of gateway, and disappearing through it before any of us could reach him.
		-I reprimanded Blade for "picking up strays", but he disclaimed responsibility, saying he
		 _tried_ to get rid of him. . .
	-Completing the journey and finding our people, I greeted Silent Onyx.
		-"Ah, you weren't spared all the excitement, up in that cell, after all!"
			-There was a battlefield nearby, still being picked over by scavengers. He said he'd
			 witnessed a battle between a Marukani legion and undead here.
		-He told us that he'd witnessed the horselord arrested by a group of Marukani soldiers.
			-Presumably from that same legion.
			-A large group of bandits were also marched into town, and he and they were then all
			 executed.
		-I asked him if he thought Kerala's family was safe here. He was fairly sure the matter of
		 the bandits and the official's corruption were the cause of the executions, making the
		 situation here a fair bit better than it was, and certainly better than the crisis in Nexus.
	-We then returned to Nexus, arriving during the night of the third day PN (Post Nexus).
		-Still no sign of Rishi.
	-A few hours after landing, we could see a purple light, emanating from the center of the
	 ruined city, periodically flickering, but moving towards the encampment.
		-That does fit the anima of one of a Sidereal we once saw among The Cult, though we did
		 not rember them well (hmm. . .).
		-Eventually, from the city, emerged. . . Sparrow, crawling on his hands and knees, and
		 bleeding from many wounds.
			-The rest of the circle and I ran to. . . her? She was the spitting image of Sparrow,
			 but appeared to be a woman in her thirties, though, still short.
				-I paused only momementarily, and then went back to work with the compresses I'd
				 had Yflea make.
				-Her wounds were grim and various, cuts, fist-blows, many different weapons.
			-"They're. . . they're going to kill us all," she said.
			 "What?!?"
			 "The elders called us, said they wanted to talk about a treaty, now that The Empress
			  has returned. It was a trap. They have. . . something. . . like demons? Like the
			  Exalted, though, too? With animas. . .
			  It wasn't a peace talk. It was a massacre. I don't think Ayesha, any of the others
			  made it. . .
			  I had to use the last of this. . . Here, I don't think I'll be needing it any
			  longer. . ."
			 -At this last, she dropped another spell-storing cord, and fell unconscious.
				-I grabbed that once we were joined by more skilled medics, bugs and Solar cultists,
				 to take over for me.
	-We then sought out the Emissary, and asked her questions about Denandsor.
		-She claimed to know how to disable the defensive systems, but warned that some may have been
		 "damaged".
		-She claimed also that it has been untouched since Master Bax built the city, and was
		 doubtlessly filled with stores.
		-"I hated each of who you once were. There's no shame in admitting that. You were monsters.
		  I don't see those same people in you."
			-Aw, shucks.
		-She also pointed out that, if "Azada" is any indication, The Cult is now leaderless. . .
			-"They'll last without support for a time. But they can only destroy, not build. . ."
		-Libak also waved Ses's tongue about for a bit, asking what the hell this thing was.
			-It seemed to be an artifact, but a strange one, reminiscent of the worms that serve
			 the demon Kimberry, the Sea That Marched Against the Flame.
		-After that, though, Libak also did his damnedest to cheer up The Emissary, kind sould that
		 he is.
	-We indeed resolved to head to Denandsor with the refugees.
		-We worked towards the construction of ships, and, with funds from The Emissary, their
		 purchase, from less devestated communities upstream.
		-I spent my time with the sorcerers among The Cult, summoning more demons, eventually 
		 switching from bottle bugs to to puppeteers, to aid with the construction of ships, wagons,
		 and litters, for the journey to The Empty City.
			-The bugs flew through whatever alcohol we found, but the demons largely remained fairly
			 well behaved. The Emissary actually seemed to exert a calming effect on them, whenever
			 she is near them.
	-We spent two weeks in the area, getting this together.
		-During that time, many among the refugees began to publicly worship the Solars among them. . .
		-The Emissary seemed to be rather scornful of this practice, though she tried to hold her
		 tongue on the score, but occasionally slipped.
		-We also spoke with Azada.
			-She confessed that the purpose of The Cult was indeed to keep an eye on Solars, since
			 we're "dangerous".
				-I can't really argue with that last bit.
			-She also said that she stopped reporting on _us_, in particular, a while back, saying
			 she trusted us.
				-She seems young for the Sidereals, mentioning she Exalted a mere 300 years ago.
			-She spoke further about the massacre, saying she saw elders slaying one another, and
			 what she was sure was the detonation of a "Spirit Bomb".
				-The fight among elder Sidereals seemed to disturb her most, as she said that, "Not
				 even during The Ursurpation did it come to violence between the _Sidereals_.
			-She also mentioned that, "No one appears to be manipulating Fate at the moment."
				-That would seem to imply grim things about how many Sidereals were slain.
				-We fell to discussing options for exploiting this vacuum, but she broke in saying
				 that it may not be possible, for the gates of Heaven were sealed by those that
				 attacked her gathering.
			-She had a warning too, saying that Denandsor had been kept empty for _a reason_.
				-There, she claimed, Kel Bax had created a "false loom", a mockery of the Loom of
				 Fate in Heaven.
					-He had been granted a moment to look at the real one in Heaven, and that turned
					 out to be enough.
			-She seemed despondant, at the (near total) loss of her kind.
				-Libak spoke, though, of the people who _still lived_, who _will_ live.
				-At the last, her eyes lit up. ". . . _they_ will live again. Their exaltations will
				 come again. And I can predict where!"
					-That was apparently how the Wyld Hunt pursued us.
					-To do so, though, required a loom.
						-Denandsor, again. . .
						-Though she did also say that an orrery, in a city far to the East, buried
						 in jungle, could also serve.
				-Finding the new incarnations of the dead Sidereals could be one route to control
				 over Fate.
		-We asked The Emissary who else knew she had access to Denandsor.
			-"Only my circle and yours, those who fled to the Inivisble Manse."
	-By a third week, ships were beginning to come together.
		-With immediate injuries now seen to, I began to fear disease. There are many thousands of
		 refugees here, in temporary housing with limited infrastructure, and _more_ are actually
		 coming, as people from the many surrounding communities that were also devestated sought
		 out aid and leadership.
			-As such, I had a hard conversation with Yflea.
				-Since returning here with us, he'd been doing all he could to help people, using
				 his considerable medical and alchemical talents, and I let him know that there was
				 a way he could do more, but one with a cost. . . one that would bind him even
				 tighter to me, and change him.
				-Yflea had become a true believer. I think I got something across to him, for he
				 considered the matter for several hours, but then he came to me, asking to be
				 transformed.
				 "I can help the people still more, entrusted with this power, and I am already
				  yours in every way I can give. We will show the people the promise of the Shining
				  Ones fulfilled!"
				-And thus I took a day to cast Imbue Amalgam.
		-Pip also asked us who the people should be rallying around.
			-We debated us, each other, and their new city, but settled on The Unconquered Sun.
			-Along with that, we decided to promote protecting one another, and preparedness, as
			 great virtues.
				-Regardless of where things go from here, these people would soon be facing many
				 enemies.
			-Lesley's write up of this all: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/948059633820528700
			-Pip then saw to a campaign to infuence the people gathering around us, implementing
			 those goals, "to prevent another disaster like this from happening again."
	-With the ships together, we were able to make the journey down river inside of another week,
	 disembarking at the closest poin to Denandsor along the Grey River.
	-From there, we journeyed across savanahs and fields of tall grass.
		-Several times, we had to scare off or slay large predators, attracted by the column of
		 people, including one memorable incident in which Golden Blade had to go chase off a
		 tyrant lizard.
		-As we neared the city, wild life grew scarcer, and plants more scarce.
		-Eventually, we could see the city's skyline, glinting gold on the horizon.
		-Approaching, though, we felt a strange dread.
	-The column stopped and set up camp ten miles from the city.
		-Pip's work seemed to be paying off. We were greeted warmly where ever we went and Blade's
		 military drills saw ever escalating attendance.
		-We also heard prayers to The Unconquered Sun, perhaps more than had been offered to him
		 since The First Age.
	-Silent Onyx and Atraxian worked together to identify an approach through the city's outer
	 defenses, and scouted ahead.
		-They reported back that the city's robotic workforce was still maintaining the city, but
		 also that there was some strange activity going on, what Atraxian thought may be a
		 "resonance" between two of the city's different systems. The result was a confusion of
		 thoughts, and the feeling of dread we'd felt.
		-She said, and indeed we'd felt, that the the dread waxed and waned. It seemed strongest
		 at dusk, and weakest just before dawn.
		-She proposed an expedition at dawn, attempting to reach the city's control room, in it's
		 central spire.
		-Blade asked her about the details of the robots seen, and she indicated that many were
		 indeed built for combat.
		-Well, I then asked her if she knew how to bypass these defenses.
			-"The city will examine your essence, allowing in those that have been granted access.
			  Certain Solars were given this, along with a family of Dragonblooded, for whom it
			  would have been heritable."
			 "And do _you_ have this access?"
			 "Yes, as do you, given by Kel Bax to your previous incarnations."
	-As dawn came, we mounted our expedition into the city.
		-Most of it, we left to our allies from The Cult, many of then well suited to stealthy
		 intrusions.
		-They were able to shut down the defenses, and the field, and we began to explore the city.
	-We set the refugees up in a district of the city, within buildings that put even Nexus's finest
	 to shame.
		-The neighborhood even features a hydroponic farm, already filled with automatically harvested
		 food, restocked and recycled over and over again across the millenia since people dwelled here.
	-There remain unexplored districts of the city, though, areas Atraxian warned us were dangerous.
		-Military bunkers or the like, which could potentially be of use, but which may have guardians
		 unknown to her.
	-With us now somewhat settled, I suggested we get eyes on the surrounding landscape, and do what
	 we can to conceal signs of our passage to the city.
		-We set our allied Solars to the task, many of them being skilled in stealth and survival.
		-There's only so much that can be done to disguise the passage of many thousands, but we did
		 what we could.
	-We also began to see further refugees wandering the land.
		-We opted to invite in those who came, and to even reach out, carefully, to groups of
		 displaced people further afield.
			-We have more than enough room and supplies, and they need our help.
		-In talking with them, we heard various rumors.
			-The Marukani are at war, not just with Thorns but maybe also with The Realm.
			-_Something_ happened at Thorns, as refugees are coming from there too. Silent Onyx
			 recalled seeing a great light, off in that direction, while "captive".
			-Refugees were coming from the East too. They report a disaster in Chaya, where a flower
			 causing insanity is blooming out of season, instead of only once per year.
	-As Azada regained her strength, she attempted to work with Fate.
		-She worked a blessing for our circle (see your bio in Roll20).
		-She also worked a blessing over Denandsor and it's (new) people too, seeking their prosperity.
	-With the people settled, though, we began to turn our eyes to the exploration of the more
	 dangerous districts.


TODO:
	-Amalgam-ify Yflea!
		-Motes available to spend: 19+45 = 64 (10 more if you spend XP on Immanent Solar Glory?)
			-Yeah, lets count on Immanent Solar Glory. Otherwise, mayb ditch the last stuff added.
		-Spending:
			15m	Basic Abilities
			8m	Essence 2 & 3
			16m	Essence Pool 20
					4m per 5 in the pool
					10 for training charms
					18 would allow ignoring reusable and one-time costs of a Master ritual.
			9m	Training charms
					Second Lore Excellency
					Third Lore Excellency
					Harmonious Academic Methodology
			6m	Sorcery
					Terrestrial Circle Sorcery
					Demon of the First Circle
			10m	Shapeshift-y disguises
				4m	Larceny 4 (with cooperation from someone, maybe Onyx?)
				3m	Second Larceny Excellency
				3m	Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise
			7m	Stealthy
				6m +3 Dexterity
				1m Stealth 1
			3m	+3 Dodge
			---
			74
			
			2m	Stamina? Mostly for flavor. Maybe Strength too.
			2m	Dexterity? Mostly for sneakiness.
			Xm	Stealth? Might need help from Onyx, beyond the one dot I've got.
				Charms? (3m, or 8m if borrowed)
					Ox-Body Technique?
					Sorcery?
						Demon of the First Circle
						Spoke the Wooden Face?
						Stormwind Rider
					Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise?
						Needs Second Larceny Excellency and Larceny itself, which I noteably can't
						train to 4 myself.
						So:
							4m	Larceny 4 (with cooperation from someone, maybe Onyx?)
							3m	Second Larceny Excellency
							3m	Flawlessly Impenetrable Disguise
					Other Stealth charms from Onyx?
					Body Mending Meditation?
				Soak? It's cheap!
				Martial arts?
				Attacks?
	-Spend XP?
		-Some charms may be useful before the amalgam-ification.
			-Immanent Solar Glory??
	-Figure out that Spell Capturing Cord you claimed from Azada.
		-Add it to your character sheet and maybe add some spells to it.
		-Oh, it comes in different-dot versions. Ask Lesley which it is.
	-Ah, you did the surgery for the Bracers of Universal Crafting, so add those to the sheet too.


3/14/22:
	-Options for further city exploring:
		-The armory, capable of the automated production of arms and armor.
		-The more general Factory-Cathedral, producing the day to day goods of The Old Realm,
		 many even magical.
	-I suggested our choice should depend on our need, and asked Golden Blade and Libak what they
	 knew of our people's situation and that of the surrounding lands.
		-Golden Blades spies and scouts report:
			-The Realm is indeed on the move, and in conflict with Lookshy.
			-The Marukani are at war with. . . someone.
			-Something happened at Thorns, and now rogue ghosts and undead roam the surrounding,
			 marauding.
			-Nexus is ruined, but the automatons I awoke to protect it continue to do so. However,
			 we've heard reports that a Wyld zone within the city was growing and spreading. . .
			-In Great Forks, many people were displaced by the water, and now have formed bandit
			 gangs.
			-In the East, in Chaya, flowers causing insanity are blooming out of season.
			-The Hundred Kingdoms are embroiled in an especially intense civil war, the worst in
			 400 years.
		-Libak meanwhile reported that our quarters were also providing us food and water through
		 the still-functioning machinery, and that he and his family have been able to see to the
		 rest of their basic needs. However, there are few luxuries.
		-Well, walls without out guards stuffed with luxuries seems like a dangerous temptation. The
		 armory it is, then.
	-With the armory our chosen target, we then consulted with The Emissary, and what records we've
	 found in the city thus far, looking for details about the area.
		-The armory is a network of six Factory-Cathedrals, capable of producing sufficient arms for
		 a legion in a day.
		-To take control of the area, we'd need to infiltrate a control room in the central manse,
		 shutting down the larger weapon systems defending the area, including armies of automatons.
		-That will leave backup systems, like redundant generators, more independent automatons,
		 and such.
		-We learned some specifics about the guards of our target too, likely to include things like
		 lightning ballistas, warstriders piloted by automata, and still worse.
			-Golden Blade suggested a distraction of some kind, and wondered at the intelligence of
			 these automated defenses.
			-I replied that such machinery was often controlled by bound Little Gods, so they are
			 indeed intelligent and reactive.
	-Traveling to the area, Libak suggested a building to visit nearby, some place his past self had
	 commissioned. . . something, that was never delivered.
		-He led us to a great pool of some kind of oil. "Cooling oil", he referred to it as, saying
		 that the device likely remained there, submerged in the oil.
		-Blade and I looked at one another, both seemingly a bit unsure of getting in the oil, but
		 Libak (literally) dived right in.
		-While he fooled around down there, Blade and I began to hear the sound of metal on stone,
		 growing closer, which turned out to be a pack of metal, wolf-like automatons.
		-They raced over to us, lunging and biting at Golden Blade, who was nearest. I was quick to
		 the fray too, though only Blade managed to land a blow.
		-The oil, though, then began to roil. . .
		-What emerged was a red warstrider, apparently piloted by Libak, since it reached out and
		 swiped one of the wolves.
		-Wolves were soon dropping like flies, as each of the three of us claim at least one kill.
		-During the fray, Silent Onyx snuck away, his distraction apparently in hand.
	-Those wolf-things sorted, Golden Blade and I clambered aboard Libak's new warstrider, and we
	 went looking for more trouble, to provide Silent Onyx more cover.
		-Approaching the well guarded street before the shielded control chamber, we got the attention
		 of a large, low-to-the-ground war machine and the warstrider behind it.
		-I lept off Libak's warstrider, onto a nearby building, and his red warstrider surged forward,
		 slamming the war machine with it's arms and whip-like tail-blade.
		-Golden Blade kept riding a while longer, leaping _forward_ from one machine, onto the
		 low guardian machine. There, he struck it again and again with his sword, until something
		 cracked, releasing smoke, and the machine went still.
		-The enemy warstrider spent this time unlimbering an axe-like weapon but, before it could
		 step forward, Libak and his warstrider lept over wreckage and Blade both, running at it's
		 counterpart and punching it with a fist.
		-It responded with an axe blow that thankfully missed.
		-Undeterred by the size of his oponent, Golden Blade ran forward to the warstrider too,
		 hacking away at it's legs with his admittedly almost as oversized sword.
		-Over his head, Libak continued battering away at their opponent too.
		-I then lept onto the enemy warstrider, from the building I'd been running along, tearing
		 away at it's paneling with my wooden claws, until finally I reached, and destroyed, the
		 equally mechanical pilot within.
		-Libak and Golden Blade then ran by me, as I rode the failing warstrider to the ground, each
		 attacking one of the two lightening ballistas in the fortified square ahead.
		-I raced forward too, engaging two mechanical men at the front of the shield dome, raking
		 each with a clawed hand.
		-A few more swipes finished that job, while Golden Blade yelled about more wolves on their
		 way.
		-This continued for some time, us against various armored security assets, when some kind
		 of combat aircraft joined the fun, blasting the area with some sort of explosive weapon,
		 which thankfully all three of us managed to avoid the blast radius of.
		-Libak rushed to engage it in his warstrider, swinging at the aircraft that only he was
		 tall enough to reach.
		-Fortunately, before he'd managed to land more than one blow, the shield around the central
		 building went down, most of the automatons went still, and the aircraft flew off.
		-Looks like Silent Onyx was successful in reaching the control room!
		-From there, I set to examining the machinery all around us, identifying functions and
		 taking notes.
	-The armory's Factory-Cathedrals are also atelier manses, capable of being set to automatically
	 produce various things.
		-They can produce anything in Wonders of the Lost Age dealing with war.
	-All that military equipment, then, made taking the rest of the city trivial, and it is now fully
	 under our control.
	-We'll be having a month of downtime before our next session.
	-After that month, reports came in about Thorns, saying The Empress used the Sword of Creation.
		-In doing so, the Shadowlands in the area were sealed.
		-The being known as the Juggernaut, a huge undead creature with a city on it's back, was
		 destroyed, and lay rotting.
		-The Mask of Winters, his citadel / war beast destroyed, also somehow lost control of his
		 undead, and retreated back to The Underworld.
		-During the last week of that month, the corpse of the Juggernaut burst, unleashing a
		 torrent of horse-sized maggots. They're cutting a path of destruction through the land,
		 and are seemingly leading here. . .


TODO:
	-Training charms?
		-_Probably_ doesn't conflict with other XP spend training?
		-Each use is a week, and Yflea can do it as well.
		-Is there a limit to how big of a group you can train?
			-Magnitude equal to trainers' essence, according to Lesley.
		-(DONE) Is Yflea, a henchman, in the "XP exempt" category for training charms? Yep!
		-(DONE) What about your other henchman? Yep!
		-(DONE) Apply Jake's training to them too.
		-Options:
			-Occult could mean eventually mean making people alchemists or general thaumaturges.
				-That would be a _long_ term thing, though, as they'd have to learn actual
				 thaumaturgy the traditional way.
			-Lore?
			-Linguistics (Old Realm)?
			-Attributes?
			-Virtues?
				-Check with Jake if he's doing Valor. If not, definitely do it.
		-Schedule (oh, two extra weeks a session or two back, according to Lesley):
			Weeks	Dragon					Yflea
			--------------------------------------------
			1		Linguistics (Old Realm)	Intelligence
			2		Lore					Integrity
			3		Wits					Conviction
			4		Charisma				Temperance
			5		Awareness				Perception
			6		Presence				Craft(Water)
			It can take you to a max of 4, except Linguistics (1), Charisma (3), Temperance (3), Perception (3), and Presence (3).
	-Stuff to build in those Factory-Cathedrals?
	-Spend more XP? You have 18.
		-8 for Essence Gathering Temper, in 1 day?
		-Craft(Magitech)?
			-Requires Air 2, Fire 2 before you can start it, for 2 XP total and no time.
			-Then 3 and 3 weeks for Magitech 1, and Rx2-1 after that.
		-Spells?
			-Eh, cheap at 8, but 3 week training time conflicts with more important Magitech.
		-Stuff from training charms?
		-So:
			XP	Time	Name
			----------------
			8	1 Day	Essence Gathering Temper
			1	Instant	Craft(Air) 2

4/4/22:
	-Pre-session stuff:
		-Training:
			-Oh, 2 of our fellow Illuminated Solars have training Charms.
				-One has Tiger Warrior Training and it's sequel.
				-The other has the first Lore one.
				-TODO: plan some stuff for that?
					-Maybe with minimal detail, unless you want to figure out their Essence and
					 other stats.
			-Azada mentioned that the Sidereals had been manipulating fate to speed training during
			 the days of the Cult. Could such a thing be possible again?
			-The Emissary has been chipping in too, with crazy Bureaucracy charms.
				-She suggested the founding of a school, and I'm using my Training charms to create
				 a cadre of teachers for it, with a focus on "careers in Magictechnology!".
				-She seems pretty down, though, being listless, and mostly just going along with
				 whatever we want, taking little initiative herself.
				-Libak does seem to be trying to cheer her up.
		-Military, given the horde of monster-maggots on their way here:
			-Golden Blade and his henchmen saw to organizing militias and watch schedules, generally
			 prepping for a defense of the city's walls.
			-I spent my time on this front in the bowels of our Factory-Cathedrals, configuring them
			 for the production of arms.
				-We create a lot of:
					-Ashigaru Skirmish Armor (BoS I pg. 79)
					-Sentinel Defense Force Armor (BoS I pg. 81)
					-Perfected Boots (BoS I pg. 52)
					-Force-Projection Weapons (BoS I pg. 76)
					-Aegis-Inset Amulets (BoS 1 pg. 71)
					-Various mundane weaponry.
	-Those maggot monsters are on their way.
		-In their wake, they leave a trail of devestation and blight. They themselves consume any
		 plant or animal matter they can reach, and anything left quickly sickens.
		-We sent out some Ashigaru/Perfected Boots/Force-Projection Weapon equipped scouts, to get
		 an idea of the capabilities of these things.
		-They reported back that they explode satisfyingly when hit by the shock pikes, yielding no
		 ranged response from the beasts.
		-Well, sounds like hit and run tactics, along with raining death from above via the skyship,
		 should make short work of these beasts.
		-Golden Blade took Libak's war strider and set out with the skirmishers again, to harry the
		 horde, while the rest of us boarded the skyship, with Pip and Yflea manning the fire lances.
			-Blade and I each donned the Torcs, to let us communicate.
		-As we approached the maggots, though, those of us aboard the ship could see four more large
		 skyships, following the column of maggots.
			-One looks like a big pagoda.
			-The three others are large, octaganol platforms, with warstriders and soldiers standing
			 on them.
				-Most are smaller warstriders, though they're joined by a few large, red jade ones.
				-The soldiers are decked out much like our own, in Ashigaru armor.
			-Looking close, I could see an emblem I recognized as belonging to the 7th Legion. Lookshy.
		-Well, they're not likely to be _very_ friendly to Solars, but we also have a common problem.
		-As such, we descided to try to parley.
		-Through the use of signal flags, Libak disclaimed hostile intent, saying we're here to deal
		 with the maggots.
		-They signaled back that a parley can wait, but that we should deal with the maggots without
		 coming to blows.
		-We set to it, and soon nothing was left of the maggots but greasy, charred stains.
	-The left us with parleying with The 7th Legion. Their troops and warstriders began to assume a
	 parade formation at one end of a narrow valley.
		-We landed our airship and formed up at the other end of the valley, and Pip and Libak set
		 about forming a negotiating party.
			-Much to Pip's chagrin, we did not have a tea set in the skyship's minimal galley.
		-Two parties of soldiers marched forward from their group, while Libak and Pip walked
		 forward to meet them as the rest of us watched from a distance.
		-Pip and Libak returned, reporting an ultimatum: they wanted control of the Factory-Cathedrals
		 of Denandsor, and would take it from us or through us.
		-Well, none of us were keen to give up what's ours, and their position is not as sound as
		 they wish us to think.
			-They don't _want_ control of the Factory-Cathedrals, they _need_ it, or face
			 destruction by The Realm.
	-We opted to retreat, racing back to the city, by air and by magic boot.
		-As we left, we delivered a very literal parting shot, tying a message to an arrow and
		 shooting it land several yards in front of them. It said, "Ultimatum denied. If you want
		 the weapons, you either deal with Denandsor as a nation or burn your legions on trying to
		 take it."
		-As we raced back, they began boarding their airships again, and giving (thankfully slower
		 than us) pursuit.
		-Arriving back at the city, we saw to activating it's defenses.
			-Most of those are in the form of combat automata, but centuries-out-of-date programming
			 and similar accumluated cruft mean that's likely to lead to homicidal kill bots
			 attacking anyone they find in the city.
			-As such, I set about doing some debugging.
		-During the first hour Yflea and I spent working on that, the 7th Legion troops began
		 building and digging in, creating a fortified camp outside the city.
			-It was insufficient to encircle the city and lay seige to us, not that our supplies
			 are limited here. Might mean they're waiting on reinforcements.
			-We decided to send Silent Onyx out to sabotage their supplies, further weakening their
			 position here, and perhaps ruining the entire effort.
			-Soon we could see flames in the camp, and smoke rising from it. . .
			-He returned shortly after that, reporting a success in his mission.
				-He even said he'd stolen the hearthstones from several of the warstriders.
		-By the second hour of debugging, Yflea had returned with a group of my newly trained
		 scholars, to assist me in my work. I then finished clearing the instruction set in short
		 order, and taking full control over the city's defenses.
			-Mostly that's a magnitude 8, might 7 legion of automata, known as Brass Legionairres.
				-Their stats are in Roll20, under "AI NPCs", along with the stats for the rest of
				 this.
			-It also includes warstriders: common, scout, and noble types.
			-There's also a unit of hover copters, several units of cybernetic tanks, and hordes of
			 cybernetic dogs.
			-Many of the buildings also incorporate concealed lightening ballista, capable
			-Most impressive, though, is the function known as "The Dome", a shield that, when
			 activated, gives the whole city Adament Skin Technique, rendering it impenetrable to
			 harm, though also preventing anyone from leaving.
		-With that done, I utilized the PA system, announcing that, "The cities defenses are now
		 under our full control. The First Light's Dragon's circle should meet him in the control
		 room."
		-They soon did, and we arranged another party to parley with The 7th Legion.
		-As they walked out from the gates, a substantial chunk of that brass legion took to the
		 walls, saluting them as they passed. With Blade and I wearing the Torcs, I then brought
		 The Dome online as soon as they were outside the gate.
	-They met our party with one of their own, and negotiations began.
		-They clearly recognized the our new position of strength in these negotiations, though
		 there was the inevitable bit of sputtering.
		-In the end, we asked for:
			-Acknowledge our sovereignty.
			-Common defense against the Realm.
			-Denandsor will join The Confederation of Rivers in Nexus's place
			-They agree to forego allying with The Realm.
			-Raw materials in exchange for our Factory-Cathedral produced weapons and armor.
		-We also agreed to return their hearthstones to them, this being a red line for them, and
		 the stones being of little use to us ourselves.
		-They only requested one additional condition: that we show our loyalty to The Confederation
		 by immediately committing troops to the struggle against The Realm.
			-Blade has toops, we can see about training more, and we have _Solars_. _Insurgency_
			 trained Solars, who can raise more troops from the countryside, and turn them into
			 elite Tiger Warriors.
				-That last is also a hell of a propaganda win for us.
		-Both parties agreed to the terms.
		-With that, Denandsor then needs to choose a council member, to represent us on The
		 Confederacy's council in Marita.
			-Well, as I pointed out, we _do_ have an Emissary.
				-She's a known quantity, having led a member of The Confederacy for centuries, and
				 more than skilled for the purpose.
				-She and the others all agreed.
	-The Emissary went off to represent us at the council, leaving us to sort out the rule of the
	 city.
	-We also went about formalizing the rule of the city by our circle directly.
	-The other members of The Cult of the Illuminated were rather resistant to openly ruling, it
	 running very much contrary to everything they'd been taught.
		-Black Powder Jack, Nissen, and Jasara the Wise supported all us in that, though, and soon
		 the others fell in line.
	-We then had a season (3 months) of relative calm.
		-Shipments of materials from Lookshy indeed began arriving, with us reciprocating with the
		 promised arms.
			-Among those materials was a large shipment of Jade, and a small shipment of Orichalcum.
			-In fact, they indicated that they have some means of producing Orichalcum. . .
	-By the end of the season, The Realm was on the move, pushing into The Riverlands.
		-Their forces gather both North of Port Calin and South, near where Thorns _was_.
	-There was also, though, a barbarian horde gathering in the North of The Riverlands.
		-Combrised of bandits and other disaffected or dispossed people from the area, the horde
		 is pillaging everywhere they passed through.
	-One day, from the West, we saw again the Sword of Creation used, attacking somewhere to the
	 Northeast, in The Hundred Kingdoms.
	-Shortly thereafter, Infallible Messengers began to arrive, telling us of the arrival of Severus,
	 a dignitary from Lookshy, who will be arriving _in an hour_.
		-He appeared amidst a flurry of flower petals, in a row boat in one of Denandsor's ponds.
		-As we went out to greet him, he flashed, on his forehead, a caste mark, the sign of Venus.
		-Introducing himself as Yoshudo Severus, he said he had only recently Exalted.
		-He also bore with him a folded set of armor, red and ninja-style.
		-He said that he, representing Lookshy, wished to smuggle us into The Blessed Isle, to
		 disable The Sword of Creation.
			-Libak admitted we had some designs on just that, and I that we had access to certain
			 resources that might facilitate that.
		-"What say you?"
			-Golden Blade was first to respond, saying simply, "Tell me where to stab."
			-I said, "It would indeed be fascinating to finally see the inside of the of the
			 thing. . ."
			-The others hemmed and hawwed a bit, but went along with it.
		-"Excellent," he responded, "With this done, we will caste down The Empress, who's misrule
		 has continued for too look, and restore the rightful order."
		 "Restore the Shogunate?" I asked.
		 "Yes."
		-He then thrust forward his burden, saying, "This is The Crimson Armor of the Unseen
		 Assassin. It has the power to take you outside of Fate, hidden from any monitoring it."
		 "How did you come by such an artifact?" I asked, "Is some other faction, beyond Lookshy
		 backing you?
		 "I only know two others of my kind," he replied, "All of us operating out of Lookshy. I've
		 tried going to Heaven, but all of the gates are locked. . ."
		-We opted to consult with Azada on this, who enthusaistically suggested we do it, saying
		 that, "You should seize control of The Sword of Creation if possible, but disable it if
		 not. Either will deny it to the hand of our enemy."
		-Over the next several hours, we conferred with Severus about the details.
			-Lookshy is gearing up to invade The Realm, attacking The Imperial City directly, from
			 the sea.
			-They're raising armies from all over The Riverlands.


TODO:
	-Sort out what you do with those 3 months.
		-Training Charms?
			-Schedule:
				Weeks	Dragon					Yflea
				--------------------------------------------
				1		Integrity				Craft(Fire)
				2		Craft(Fire)				Craft(Air)
				3		Craft(Air)				Lore
				4		Wits					Lore
				5		Craft(Magitech)			Perception
				6		Craft(Magitech)			Intelligence
				7		Craft(Magitech)			Investigation
				8		Craft(Magitech)			Conviction
				9		Valor					Socialize
				10		Intelligence			Socialize
				11		Occult					Linguistics (High Realm)
				12		Occult					Linguistics (Low Realm)
				It can take you to a max of 4, except Perception (3), Linguistics (3), Valor (3), and Craft(Fire or Air) (2)
			-What about those other NPCs with Training charms?
				-Notes from last session say 2 of our fellow Illuminated Solars have training Charms.
					-One has Tiger Warrior Training and it's sequel.
					-The other has the first Lore one.
			-_Who_ do you train?
				-Yflea trains up to 75 people and The Dragon up to 300.
				-Prioritize folks going with us to The Blessed Isle, though ensure that at least 30
				 or so people staying in Denandsor get the Magitech 4 training, and bits of Lore and
				 Occult, to provide the city a cadre of trained engineers in my absence.
				-Offer seats in the clases up to allied factions, even Lookshy, if there's space
				 after the forces we control who are coming with on the mission.
		-Spend some XP?
			-13 to spend.
			-The 4th dot in Craft(Magitech), so that you can start training it?
				-5 XP and done immediately.
				-Yeah, lets assume you do this for training planning.
				-Still need to apply it and pay the XP!
			-All-Encompassing Sorcerer's Sight might be the top candidate for a Charm since it will
			 open your eyes to all sorts of useful stuff that you can apply your Lore and Occult too.
			-Essence-Lending Method, to keep the party going for a potentially grueling excursion
			 to The Blessed Isle?
			-Second Martial Arts Excellency, to further boost offense?
				-Eh, per attack makes the excellencies _expensive_.
		-Building stuff?
		-Summoning?
			-Summon a Hopping Puppeteer, to serve you as a necklace.
				-Figure out the appropriate Abiscissic Binding for it and add it to macros.txt.


TODO:
	-Summon a Hopping Puppeteer?
		-Kind of seems like you can shrink them down to something portable.
			-Limit triggers might be a problem, though.
		-Having access to Measure the Wind as needed is crazy useful by itself.
			-Can find Exalts and the like by their essence!
			-And now, with Essence Gathering Temper, figure out their essence to see if you
			 should use that defense or something else.
	-Become skyship pros.
		-You're a good candidate for maintenance. Figure that system out.
			-Ah, sounds like no need for maintenance, due to it's First Age origin, but I _do_
			 want as much Craft(Magitech) as I can get to repair _damage_ to it:
			 https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/928857661095702578
		-Talk to folks about learning enought to crew it ourselves?
			-Discussed it here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/928849921451393045
			-Sounds like Pip is both interested in and well suited for being the primary pilot.
			-Getting one more circle member to Lore 1 and Sail 2 is enough to fly it ourselves, or
			 ideally get all 5 to it, for a full crew and no maneuverability penalties.
	-Turn that iron ore into cold iron weapons.
		-You could have hook swords or a seven-section staff made for yourself, since they would be
		 usable with your Martial Arts score (instead of Melee) and your Snake Style charms.
		-A pair of hook swords seems like the preferable option, but both have pluses and minuses.
			-Easier to say they're all made of iron, though.
	-Recruit. Cultists, followers, and allies all.
		-Ask your monks to step up efforts on that front?
			-The manse can support many more people.
		-Make a true Ally of Rishi?
			-Offer him Sorcery?
				-"I not eager to advertise it, or how easily I picked it up. It marks me as. . .
				  something other than a normal human."
					-An angle he should be sympathetic to, and also why he himself my have a higher
					 than normal Essence.
			-One way or another, you'd probably like to eventually bring him into the circle's
			 secret.
				-You might also need to explain that there was more in the NE than you admitted, and
				 the bigger secret is the (hopefully understandable?) reason why.
				-Done! Mostly went well, I think? Libak handled it while I was busy.
		-You'd love to talk to that Illuminated kid who believes he did bad stuff in The First Age.
			-Search: "terrible things, committed atrocities"
			-You can definitely sympathize. It touches on a fear of your own, though one which you
			 couch in terms of failure, rather than moral wrongs.
			-Perhaps you can bond with him over this, promise to help watch each other, keep honest.
	-The Inivisible Manse's hearthstone is amazing.
		-See Hearthstone_of_the_invisible_fortress.odt
		-Add your extra health levels in Roll20.
			-Done!
		-Begin exploiting those stored rolls.
			-Existing banked stuff of interest:
				-Recognizing the old Solars of the manse perfectly could be used on each other
				 or The Mask of Winters to interesting effect.
				-"the ability to lie to other solars and maintain a ruse as a perfect effect" is
				 crazy powerful and useful.
			-Can you bank demon binding rolls?
				-What are the implications given that it's a _repeated_ roll?
		-"master bax' escape ship"?!?
			-Eh, sounds like we'll have to follow up on that when we return to the manse.
	-Downtime demons.
		-Got a start on that, following your solo adventure, but do more!
	-Claim more artifacts?
		-The Audient Brush is up your alley.
			-Asked here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/892279585163587585
		-Did anyone else claim the Torcs of Unified Action? I think I heard some discussion.
			-Asked here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/892278593135194183
			-If not, it would add an interesting communication link to the network you're beginning
			 with your wooden faces.
			-Onyx would be a good candidate for the other.
			-It shares _a lot_, though. . .
				-Maybe with one of my followers then? Though that could screw with his morale. . .
					-Ah, but maybe serve as a guard against following Larquen's path?
		-No need to really _claim_ it, but, even without Medicine, you might be decent at researching
		 the herb combos required for that hookah.
		-Eventually implant The Bracers of Universal Crafting.
			-You can wear other bracers over them!
			-Obviously for once you have crafting Abilities.
	-Dispose of that grisly mask?
		-Or keep it, for whatever significance it may hold to The Mask of Winters?
			-Now kind of getting the impression _Larquen_ may be The Mask, rather than Meherrin,
			 which would now make it no longer a body part, but maybe still a thing of significance.
				-Looking at notes above, it doesn't sound like you incinerated Larquen's body yet. . .
				-Gathering a Ghost's Strings, a Necromancy spell from Larquen's journal, could
				 identify fetters and such, _if I can see the ghost when I cast it_.
				-Ah, Meherrin, though, may be another Deathlord!
	-Read some stuff via your Wooden Face.
		-Search TODO above. At least two things exist.
		-The letters_to_mithra.pdf as well.
		-Oh! _Can_ you do this? Look at the spell description, if you can switch your perception
		 back and forth or not.
			-Yep!
		-Done:
			-First half of Larquen's manual of sorcery.
			-The tablet describing the operation of the rock weaving machine.
	-Bring back Kalbax's architectural drawings, and go through them.
		-Both the details of manse construction and blueprints for ancient buildings around Creation,
		 Nexus included, seem useful.
		-Oh! In his secret bed chamber, that gets turned up to 11!  Search "manse blueprints" above.

		-"Manse Construction, by Kal Bax":
			-Celestial Circle:
				Raise the Puissant Sanctum (White Treatise pg. 79).
			-Solar Circle:
				The Solar spell works in the same way, but works instaneously, and costs 20 more motes.
			-In addition, it adds +5 auto successes to design rolls when constructing manses
			 and allows for construction of manses with UNLIMITED manse creation points.
		-The Cult of Illuminated can teach spells on pg. 99 of the book of the same name. It's a 1E
		 book, though, so some of the spell smay no longer exist, and the book names are wrong.
	-Use the phylactery more.
		-Suspend even _wackier_ spells?
		-Manifestation would allow, GM permitting, stuff like, say, _Fire_ Dragon's Claws.
			-What can it do with summoning spells? Summon something _else_?
	-More Wooden Faces?
		-Can you get a tree growing at The Invisible Manse? Maybe with the help of that wood spirit
		 we briefly saw on the way up to the manse, or similar? Lore/Occult checks to figure that out?
			-Yep, sounds like it: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/882494098081194006
			-Wood elemental could soon be summonable by you.
		-What about a sewer tree, or tree in the Underground Sanctuary?
	-Justify the servitude of those demons by offering banishment, what they sought?
	-Acquire more cultists.
	-Work with your allied (or "allied" exalts):
		-The fey-bound deathknight
			-Ask her if she knows Necromancy, now that you can self-initiate into it.
				-Even if you don't want to learn something yourself right now, can she _write it
				 down_?
			-What happens if _she_ is shown the mirror?
		-The Wyld-Hunt-affiliiated Terrestrial
			-Raised her oath again here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/884538294606643210
			-Ask her what she knows of deathknights, they being the thing she claimed to be truely
			 concerned with?
				-Introduce her to our captive one?
	-Create a factory-cathedral. Kal Bax's writings brings this into the realm of eventually possible
	 for you, and would certainly help restore the glories of The First Age.
		-See Oadenol's pg. 78 for more info on the subject.


TODONE:
	-Pick up that ordered armor.
		-You returned to Nexus roughly a week after ordering it, so need to wait three more weeks.
	-Figure out what's going on with that ghost/spirit/whatever that's fucking with us in the manse.
	-Continue looking through the tombs.
	-Downtime mask servant interactions:
		-Ask them a lot about their subjective experience.
			-"Do you. . . miss what you now lack?"
			-You're a bit unsure what you think if this was a great blessing sort-of-you gave them, or
			 a terrible atrocity you/he committed. You're terribly tempted by this wonder, and want to
			 believe it's a _gift_, one the your monks/family would be _glad_ to have. You're just also
			 a bit horrified by the idea of _being_ such a being.
			-Did a little bit of this in session. Search "I asked him how he felt about that" above.
		-Ask them about Larquen Quen?
			-_Probably_ leaving out your connection to him, at least at first. If pressed as to the
			 reason for your curiosity, you can volunteer an interest in sorcery, and his writings
			 that you found.
	-Figure out what to do with the artifact dagger, and those red jade blades and breastplate.
		-The dagger: dagger, +1 acc, +2 dam, 3m attune, +1 acc every additional mote spent (max 5)
		-I had been thinking the jade stuff may also be artifacts, but that seemed less likely,
		 after the way Lesley revealed dagger stats more or less immediately upon examination.
			-Ah, sounds like they are artifacts indeed.
		-The "Slayer Katars" from Kotor Velos too.
			-See Roll20 for stats.
		-And whatever Libak was stabbed with, in the maze.
			-Stats from Lesley: "pointy: speed 5, acc +1, dam +2Agg, def +0, Rate 3"
	-That prophecy about a battle and perhaps mastering a great evil?
		-Does anything at the hidden manse count as "a great battle"?
			-You're kind of paranoid since that encounter, and always looking for signs of it.
		-Lore checks about demons? _Are_ these creatures likely to use their freedom to cause
		 Creation ill, or otherwise so vile they deserve the the suffering inflicted on them?
			-That _you_ sort of inflicted on them. . . You're trying to justify what sort-of-you
			 did to them, and to maybe justify retaining a demonic construction crew.
			-They are: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876860647378411550
	-Do you know anything about Larquen Quen already? Make another Lore check?
		-Lesley's answer: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876862341491347476
			"you dont know much about larquen quen, except what you have discovered at the previous manse. he knew when he died he would reincarnate, he also knew he would need time to train and a mentor to train him. he built a manse and had several people there to assist him with the training. he was considered a powerful and respected sorceror who knew how to use the spirits of creation to do his bidding.
			the only thing you know from your manse is that he was developing a new kind of magic, something he discovered with his time amongst a group called "the black Nadir Concordant." whatever the magic was it was considered dangerous to even the first age solars and was made illegal
			and, with what you have found from the pages of that book, maybe the masks have something to do with that"
		-Totally plays into what I'm interested in exploring with Garn, as I discuss here, in
		 response to the above: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876865918146342963
	-That runestone TODO, above.
	-Investigate the "manual of sorcery by Larquen Quen".
		-Search the quote for it in the notes.
		-It was described as missing the back half of it's pages.
		-Read what you can, and read it _to_ your monks for archiving.
			-The discussion about what I already knew about Larquen revealed some tidbits of what's
			 in there: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/876862341491347476
				-The especially-relevant-to-the-book bit:
					"the only thing you know from your manse is that he was developing a new kind of magic, something he discovered with his time amongst a group called "the black Nadir Concordant." whatever the magic was it was considered dangerous to even the first age solars and was made illegal
					and, with what you have found from the pages of that book, maybe the masks have something to do with that"
			-Lesley posted the bit that's readable in Roll20. READ IT!
				-It's entitled "Concerning Spirits".
				-He. . . comes off as a colossal dick, even in his own writings.
					-A slaver and worse, sorcerously contorting the bodies of his victims, and
					 eventually manipulating their very souls.
				-The mask servants are now a kind of _god_, at the cost of their freewill, and thus
				 allowing the development of unique magical powers, as we likely saw with the cook's
				 conjured food.
					-A _necessary_ cost? Or Something Larquen considered a _feature_?
				-He also journeyed to the Underworld, a taboo, invited along by Meherrin to loot
				 the tombs of the slain primordials for the secrets of Sorcery lost with them.
					-It's where they come to the tombs that it's cut short by the torn out pages. . .
		-Then Incantation of Effective Restoration can probably restore it!
			-"The sorcerer also needs more than half of the decayed item's remains to restore it."
				-Pg. 50 of Books of Sorcery vol. 2
			-Sounds like it passes muster. Roughly half the pages are missing, but I think the
			 covers were mostly intact.
				-Yep, Lesley confirmed it should work.
			-Yep, did it, and the second half is now in Roll20.
	-Figure out a source of more food.
		-Our limited stores are running low.
		-Libak seems like he's getting charms to address that.
			-He made a trip and came back with two deer, three lunars, and even news that they'd
			 counterspelled the blizzard!
		-Ritual of Elemental Empowerment could potentially help a little bit too, giving +3 dice to
		 Resistance rolls vs. cold.
	-Examine the bamboo sword, from the 9/13/21 session.
		-See The Greenwood Blade in Roll20.
	-Write up your usual monk check-in protocol.
		-Avoid further surpises, like at the return to Nexus.
		-Blow essence each night before sleeping?
	-Did anyone implant the Bracers of Universal Crafting? If not, it's getting to the point you could
	 make decent use of them.
		-Sounds like they're yours! Get Yflea to implant them when you get back to Nexus.
			-Ah, or, perhaps better, a bottle bug. You've been presuming you've kept yours around,
			 resummoning it as needed.
			-Can't find the surgery rules, though. Ask Lesley.
		-They also can indeed go under your Orichalcum Bracers.

TODON'T:
	-Perhaps pursue that Windigo?
		-Might help ingratiate ourselves with that Wyld-Hunt-affiliiated Terrestrial, who had been
		 hunting it herself, or even help gain cultists, if we publicly claim credit for it.
		-Raised it here: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/884559331570380840
		-Do Lore checks and talk with the Terrestrial to figure out if we can take it, though.
			-Heard this from Lore/Occult, but doesn't give a clear idea if we can take it: https://discord.com/channels/785604556934742036/785604557518405654/884595066000269393
	-Sewer expansion? (Too late now!)
		-You can summon suitable demons.
		-underground_sanctuary.pdf mentioned the old Nexus subway, and that only some of the
		 terminal's still exist. Could others be restored?
		-With The Emissary's sanctuary law, Nexus is now a _big_ target, and could use things like
		 bomb shelters. . .
